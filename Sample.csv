The baguettes and rolls are excellent, and although I haven't tried them yet I'm excited about the dozen-plus types of filled croissants on offer at ridiculously low prices. &#160;Cheese, with or without ham? &#160;Blueberry, with or without cream cheese? &#160;Chocolate, almond? &#160;This could be dangerous. &#160;I have a bad bakery habit, but at least at Q Bakery I won't go broke while I get fat. &#160;I've tried four different banh mi, and I'll agree with Matthew that the basic ones are somewhat Americanized. &#160;Mushroom was more interesting than chicken or BBQ pork, obviously. &#160;That made this a good place to get food for the in-laws that seemed exotic, but not too scary. &#160;(Note to self: don't publish this on Facebook, where the in-laws might see it.) &#160; Q Bakery's location on two divided streets makes it a slight pain to get to, but it's worth a stop if you want affordable variety. This used to be the location of my favorite Bahn Mi shop in Seattle, King Baguettes, so when I saw that, after one year as a Pho restaurant, that a new Bahn Mi joint had taken up residence. &#160;With dreams of King Baguettes' Chicken Bahn Mi dancing in my head I quickly rushed in.At first examination, Q Bakery is a lot more welcoming than the old King Baguette. &#160;There are a variety of baked goods in the cases, and they have both Bahn Mi and regular deli sandwiches available. &#160;I had both a pork and a teriyaki chicken bahn mi, and I found that they didn't quite hit the mark.  On the plus side, Q Bakery is not stingy with the meat, and the meat is both flavorful and juicy. &#160;The teriyaki chicken was especially interesting as I've never had a bahn mi like it before, and I quite enjoyed it. &#160;Also, Q Bakery is mercifully light on the mayonnaise. &#160;On the down side, both my sandwiches lacked much kick. &#160;They tasted like an Americanized bahn mi, with all the asian flavors toned way down. &#160;The baguette itself was also kind of disapointing, being more chewy than crusty.For a brand new place, however, I think Q Bakery has a lot of potential, and I look forward to trying them out again in the near future. YUM! I always, always look forward to visiting my family in Seattle, WA so I can get all types of baked goodies from Q's. They are known for their banh mi's. I usually order the banh mi cha lua.. The customer service, is getting better. English is obviously not their second language, but many establishments these days aren't anyways! Love this place. &#160;We mostly go there for the Vietnamese sandwiches. &#160;I usually go for the veggie ones - they're full of flavorful tofu and a great assortment of veggies. &#160;I don't feel like I've just had a sandwichful of bread after eating there - it actually feels like I've eaten my veggies. &#160;My husband gets the meat sandwiches. &#160;He says he likes Q's sandwiches because chicken is not shredded, the sandwich is "bigger" and the store is great because it's better lit, better arranged, and tidier than some.Having lived in France (and eaten my way though many-a-patisserie) I have to add that Q's pastry selection and taste are pretty awesome. I'm talking straight up delicious pains au chocolat and pains aux raisins. &#160;They also have all sorts of candies in jars, and sesame treats. &#160;They have one or 2 tables w/ 4 or 6 chairs for eating in. &#160;They're open til 7pm. &#160;Also, they take cards, which makes it handy if we don't have cash.One star off because it's been a little tough to communicate with the folks there since we don't speak Vietnamese. &#160;Wouldn't be a problem except we've ended up with the wrong food before. Overall, great little place. &#160;And I'll totally be bringing my parents there when they come to visit this weekend - thanks for the idea, Matthew!PS - Brought my mom there when she came for a visit and she loved it. &#160;Naturally, the 'rents had never had a Vietnamese sandwich before; great way to introduce them to the magic of banh mi.
I live up the street from Betty. &#160;When my sister was in town for Spring Break, we made an effort to hit several little places we had never been to before.BETTY WAS PRETTY SWEET!The service was lively. &#160;We made a reservation (via Yelp of course) and were seated right away by the window for a group of four. &#160;I love sitting by the window because I want to be seen when I'm out. &#160;It was really a pleasant evening.Three of us had the Betty Burger, which was substantially larger than I expected. &#160;My sister had the pan roasted chicken, which was also generously portioned.For those of you who would be traveling to Queen Anne from elsewhere, FREE PARKING ON QUEEN ANNE AVE, WHOOOHOOO! :) Wow.. Came here for Happy Hour and never knew this place had a back room. I highly recommend coming here for Happy Hour. The place is classy with just enough dark ambiance to make this place sexy. The food was great! We went small place style and got the following items. Happy Hour Clams were amazing. The broth was interesting with just enough kick to it. Hour Hour Frites - Yummy fries. How can you go wrong with frieds.Happy Hour Lemon Drop - Tasty, tasty, tasty!Happy Hour Oysters - YUM!Happy Hour Wine by the glassMix GreenYes.. Betty. I heart you! I recently tried Betty for the first time and boy, am I ever a fan. The ambiance was fantastic. We were slightly surprised at how short the menu was. At first it put us off a little bit, but we both found something that sounded like it could be ok.When the food came, our choices were validated. I had the lamb ragout. It had plenty of meat, fresh peas, rich sauce and freshly made noodles. It was a huge amount of food but the flavors were so amazing that I managed to eat the entire thing.Be sure to get reservations (http://opentable.com makes it easy.) Not bad BettyWent here for dinner with friends. Don't be confused by the velvet curtain as you walk through the door. Weird way to keep the cold out. They can seat about 8 at most. The server was friendly. Tried the Betty burger and beer. Burger was huge and not as flavorful as I hoped. The fries were burnt and not that great. I tried my friend's dishes and I'll have to get the chicken next time. No one tried the rib eye steak and frites and I'm curious about that one. The menu is already changing, but never let's me down. I've been here at least 10 times and have never been served a mediocre meal --everything here is delicious.The service is exceptional and very friendly. The setting is casual, and conveniently located on Queen Anne Ave.It can be a little pricey, but certainly worth it. I wouldn't say that I was a fan, but this is an okay place to go. &#160;I'd say it's a seven of ten more than a three of five, but I round halves down.Mom was up visiting from Alabama. &#160;I don't know why she ever agrees to go out with us, because it is always the same: &#160;too slow, too expensive, too salty, one dollar should be enough tip.This time she didn't grouse about the tip, although she'd been skipped on the water service (as I had), but she remarked on the friendliness of the people there. &#160;Service was timely. &#160;I also ordered a to-go meal for my wife who wasn't with us, they timed it perfectly. &#160;On a separate check, in fact, which they had no problem doing.They got us in during Seattle Restaurant Week, which was awesome.I had the Wild Boar spaghetti (I think they had a fancier name for it, but that's what it was), which my brother also had. &#160;He didn't like it at first, but liked it at the end. &#160;I noticed no improvement, but I liked it from the get-go. &#160;Brother had a point though, he would have had no problem making any of those dishes at home, except the scrumptious desserts.The food was oversalted. &#160;The salt was pretty pervasive, and that's really my only knock on the joint.Takeaway: &#160;I recommend that you try it. &#160;I can see why some people have it as a favorite, it's just not one of mine. The only reason I wouldn't go back here is because your clothing always smells like bacon grease or something when you leave. &#160;It takes a few washes to get the smell out. &#160;Other than that, the wine pours are nice, the staff is great and their tapas is delish. &#160;Wear an old coat when you go there though, you've been forewarned. This is my go-to restaurant for happy hour in Queen Anne! The menu is amazingly delicous, both for HH and the regular menu. The HH menu is priced really well and the five dollar wine pours are too tempting to not pass up! The frites are delicious with just the right amount of salt. They always have either clams or mussels, and both are my favorite thing to get off of the HH menu! The pulled pork mole tacos are tasty, too, and my husband always orders them when we go.Service is friendly, helpful and relaxed. They aim at letting you have a great time in the restarant, with no pressure about getting you in and out quickly, which is appreciated.Oh - and about two years ago I got a savory stinging nettle risotto that I still dream about to this day. It was THAT good. And right now I'm waiting for the right time to go and have their halibut... oh it should be heavenly!Definitely go to Betty if you're around the top of QA. And by 'definitely go', I mean, 'go all the time!'PS: In the summertime they open up their back patio - woohoo!! Sunshine AND great food!! (Excellent time to get the prosecco and some salami + olives on a Friday evening!) The original dinner plan was Lloyd Martin, then suddenly the place was on fire. And by that I mean it included fire trucks. So, I met Peter and Ron at Betty instead. NEVER have I waited so long for a burger. The servers were incredibly good but the kitchen was as devastatingly slow as drowning in ice water in Hell. The drinks were weak and overly expensive.The food was average but sorta pretty.I rank Betty high for service only. My boyfriend and I were looking for a casual place to eat in Upper Queen Anne and have always wanted to try Betty. &#160;I was very surprised to see bottles of wine in ice buckets on customer's tables, but I was very pleased to see that we were in for a treat. &#160;We shared an order of Sauteed Squid and Green Olives, which was absolutely delicious as a starter. &#160;It was also pretty plentiful for an app. &#160;We both then shared a Ribeye Steak and also substituted the fries (after seeing a HEAPING load of fries on another customer's plate) with some mixed organic greens (yum!!). &#160;The ribeye steak was very plentiful, it would've been too much for one person. &#160;It was SO GOOD. are you too lazy to marinate a chicken and pan roast it to perfection in a cast iron skillet for dinner tonight?not to worry, betty has got you covered. the meat will be succulent and well seasoned. heck, they will even through in some roasted potatoes and vegetables. who needs to order sides?i'm afraid I won't order anything else here now. Found this place when our first choice in Queen Anne couldn't guarantee our reservation. Overall, we were quite pleased with the food and the ambience. Unlike some places nearby, you can actually have a conversation and it has a nice feel to it. &#160;The food is good,although the wine list leaves a bit to be desired.Service is OK. They are pleasant, but you get a lot of "no"'s from them. Simple requests are greeted with a "no". &#160;We had a birthday, and while I really don't mind paying for my own dessert, an acknowledgement would at least be nice. &#160;Why else would you ask? This is a place that does things right. We went to Betty's for happy hour after walking y it so many times. All items were very reasonably priced, we tried several different things and we were pleased with all of them. The menu might be a bit too traditional if you will, but the food was cooked right. Also if you sit at the counter you can see the chefs cook your food which is a definite plus, I like to see what goes into my plate and I like it when the kitchen is kept in a proper manner and they are not afraid of showing it to the customers. Could be the nicest staff I've ever encountered. &#160;And the food was excellent. &#160;I'll be back... Pretty good if you are looking for pub/bistro fare. But don't expect great things if you order a steak or anything "fancy." Delicious. Tthere are so many tempting things on their menu it's hard to know where to begin. &#160;The parmesan tarte is like a cloud--not quiche, not custard with the flavor of fresh parmesan, it defies words. &#160;The homemade pea soup equally fine--tasted the fresh herbs and split peas soft but still holding their shape, and not too heavily flavored with ham--perfect for this extended winter weather. &#160;Several entrees on the menu--fragrant chicken, a vegetarian tangine among others. I ordered the braised/stewed lamb shank. &#160;Betty's version is superb--marvelous lamb that has been slow cooked so that the meat falls off the bone served with a rich vegetable-enhanced tomato-based sauce and a bed of creamy polenta. &#160;Never had lamb that tasted as good as this. &#160;Usually declining dessert, on the fabulous $30 deal this month I indulged. Either of the homemade ice creams are sublime--one with a Guiness caramel sauce and the other, a homemade wedge of Neopolitan ice cream (the strawberry layer tasted like FRESH strawberries!) rests in a shallow pool of dark chocolate fudge sauce. &#160;And three thin dark chocolate shortbread coins hail invitingly from the top of the ice cream wedge daring you to dip them into the fudge sauce too! &#160;Strongly recommend Betty for anyone who knows the difference between ordinarily good and extraordinary! &#160;Betty is in that extra-excellent category. &#160; I found service to be wonderful--fast, warm, not intrusive and I liked the modern feel of the place. &#160;Lighting that was just right for regular meal or romance! Not pretentious, very welcoming, elegant enough to feel like you have dined well. This has become our "go-to" place for great food. &#160;It gets better every time we go. &#160;The burger is great, the chicken is great, and the cassoulet was amazing when we went. &#160;You can't go wrong with anything on the menu - check it out! The menu is small and simple and the atmosphere is exactly what you'd expect in upper Queen Anne, a great date night spot. &#160;We were a little confused by the entrance which appears to be an entrance to nowhere, but once we passed through the curtain and took our seats everything was great. &#160;We both ended up with the roast chicken, partly because of an ordering gaffe on my part, but I couldn't have been happier. &#160;The chicken was moist and tender and had a delicious crispy skin and the portion size was perfect. &#160;Betty definitely found a spot in the regular rotation for me and the girlfriend. Never been here before or heard of the place. &#160;Went here for the $30 prix fixe menu..this was really a great neighborhood restaurant. &#160;Service was very very slow though...first course was parmesan pudding and grapefruit vinigrette...$12 and $14 respectively...very tasty, the grapefruit added a nice kick..the melted parmesan on crostini was very tasty and it had a pesto add in to round it off...entree was roast chicken and pork loin atop savoy cabbage..the pork was really good and the sauce with the cabbage was very peppery...almost too peppery but I like spicy...The roast chicken was really good too, the breast was moist. &#160;mid $20 range for both..dessert was $8 for any dessert, got the guiness ice cream with brownie bites without the shot of alcohol and the panna cotta...never had panna cotta before, it was with grapefruit....unusual gelatin consistency..not bad but not really good, the candied grapefruit rind was too intense...the ice cream was fine, just ice cream with brownies...can't go wrong with that... Don't think you can go wrong with Betty. Unpretentious, good food and service. Happy hour is especially nice, impressed with their wine by the glass selections and generous pours! Very comfortable, from making reservations the day of for a business dinner , to greeting us, to the ease of the menu. &#160; the Queen Anne area is a very busy place and parking is crazy. I had the duck confit with a lamb sausage, swiss chard. &#160;good comfort food for a california person eating in the "cold (not yet) NorthWest.
I'm worried about how I will review this place because I strongly think that it was just a bad night and that otherwise this place might be a lot better..Here's the first no-no .. what Mexican Food place runs out of avocado? A vegetarian friend of mine ordered a meatless dish that relied heavily on avocado and about 15 minutes after ordering and drooling over what she was expecting to eat, the waitress approached our table and told her the bad news. Not only was this bad for her, but almost all of the dishes we ordered at our table of 8 people included avocado as well. D'oh!The service was a little slow, the waitress wasn't very friendly or helpful and when the food arrived some people had to wait 5 minutes for their plate when others were already eating. Here's where it got really bad/awkward...Large groups can never really seem to get it together when it comes to paying the bill. However - we sat down as a group and decided that the service didn't amount to a 20% tip. After asking to split the tab a few ways as we were a large group the waitress huffed and puffed, roller her eyes and said "usually we DONT do this..". We calculated the tip all together and then were headed out the door when we were caught off guard by someone shouting in our direction. We turn around and it's the waitress.. she approaches us and says her tip wasn't large enough and that she was insulted and felt that we should give her more money.Granted.. she seemed embarrassed to ask us that.. but REALLY? For the size of our group the gratuity was already added to the bill and we each gave her a little more than that. I don't know if she had trouble with math or if she misread the bill but she literally asked for a bigger tip. WHO DOES THAT? Especially when they couldn't complete our orders or serve the food together. The food wasn't terrible but I don't think I'll ever go back.. Nice atmosphere, in an old house in Phinney Ridge area. &#160;Have only eaten there once (had some tacos and they were absolutely delicious, and the selection of homemade salsas was really great, too), but it's a really nice place to go have a margarita, listen to some punk or country on the jukebox, and just chill out. &#160;Looking forward to hanging out on their porch in the summertime! Fast review!Dined on Tacos with Fake Meat (Which were tasty!) and a Bartenders Margarita (Just tasted like a normal marg, but was strong enough to make up for the lack of pom juice). The pineapple salsa was delicious, but not chunky like some pineapple salsa I have had before, but still delicious. Oh oh! And the chips were crispy. There is nothing worse than stale chips at a restaurant.EDIT: changed stars. It wasn't that fabulous. Plus it was way too crowded to be super enjoyable.AtmosphereIt was busy, but I went on a Friday evening around 6:30. The seating arrangements could be improved, I unfortunately was sitting next to a busy &#160;walkway and was bumped around quite a bit. I wish that they had more Chupacabra stuff though. Maybe a story on the menu (if they did, I missed it, whoops) The single sad little bat hanging from the ceiling could have enjoyed the company of a friendly goat eating chupacabra. How festive! Everyone wants to see carnage while they dine! Maybe they can put butcher paper on the tables or paper placemats and they can have the patrons draw chupacabra pictures! More chupacabra at El Chupacabra. Cozy, fun atmosphere, but can be crowded (no reservations, but there is a wait list you can sign when you get in).Great margaritas, affordable, tasty food good for vegetarians and omnivores alike. &#160;Stop by and check it out. Yup. Its small. &#160;When its busy, the list is rarely actually paid attention to. &#160;The waitresses have a care less attitude. &#160;But, the beer is cold and the food doesn't cause Salmonella. &#160;See, I'm not like most people. &#160;When a waitress is a little less attentive than she should be, I don't take away a star, I add one. **Only if she has good tattoos. I had very low expectations from word of mouth - but this was just what i wanted! Chips and Salsa: stat! Guac: stat! Margs: stat!Bring that triple threat and it's hard to put a furrowed brow on my face. We needed food - we needed casual - we got it. This is a cool little house on Greenwood with a front porch patio and indoor decor screaming dia de los muertos everywhere. We shared tacos, one shrimp order and one special with smoked salmon. The shrimp were the runner up fave - unpredictably spicy on some bites, nice and tasty for others, but the little shrunken suckers were hard to find. The salmon on the other hand; smack me now- i've never had a salmon taco, but these were awesome! With avocado and a few additions of veggies, i loved them. Service was perfectly punctual and our waitress was stylish and friendly. The margaritas were refreshing and tasty. Not too strong, which boded well for this outing. Overall good dinner out and recommended for a low-key, fun and lively night. Not bad. Food pretty good, service was fine, decent prices and the atmosphere was interesting. I"m a big fan of this place. It's in a great location and bartenders are friendly. The jukebox is one of my favorite of all time- filled with punk and metal (I don't see that enough). The food was great. I ordered a Carne Asada Burrito and friggin loved it. Cheap drinks and happy hour and late night specials. HIMSA RIP Even though I've had some good times here, I can't bring myself to give more than three stars, especially since I think those times are in the past.I seriously doubt I would ever come here on my own anymore, knowing of at least a few Mexican places I like more that are even closer to home than El Chupa, and in fact, the last few times I've been here, it has only been because others wanted to.Don't get me wrong, the food is not bad, it's just not great, I can get better food elsewhere. The atmosphere is dandy, I've always liked the coziness and decor, and on a warm day it is pleasant inside with the door open if the deck outside is full.The drinks used to be real ass kickers, but a while back I realized that the margaritas were just not cutting it any more. I could blame it on the fact that I've found another margarita elsewhere that just tastes so good, El Chupa's doesn't stand a chance, but in the past the sheer amount of alcohol in the would have held them up. Last couple of times I had them, not so much. Yesterday I tried the mojito. It was fine, but that was all, nothing more. It tasted okay, but could have been tastier and certainly could have had more alcohol.And the service? Well, it wasn't horrible, but it started off bumpily enough that one of my lunchmates and I simultaneously had a "WTF?" moment aloud to one another. It seemed like the table next to us had been visited by the server 3 times while we we waited patiently with folded menus for our order to be taken. After that, everything showed up in a pretty timely fashion, but while we had arrived in enough time to order the specials, by the time our order was taken, 3 o'clock had come and gone. No specials for us.To sum it up, I suppose if I am with someone who really wants to go, I'll go again, but I wouldn't bother on my own. Sorry El Chupacabra, the honeymoon is over. Give the place a try, it is a lot of fun to watch the crowd, and the food is quite good. Their homemade sauces that you find on the table and can have with chips or over nachos is out of this world. I wish they would sell it for home use actually. &#160;The deck in the spring, summer and early fall is a must do. Especially on a hot summer day it's great, but you can wait for some time as it's very popular. Cold beers and great food. How can you go wrong. Prices are very reasonable too. Fun atmosphere, comes across as something you'd expect in more of a college area but I don't mean that negatively. The crowd looked to be mostly young professionals, the staff was friendly, service was quick, and the food was very good, although not amazing mexican food. Margaritas were good as well. Only complaint was the dessert - fried tortilla with cinnamon and honey which really was not very good... I hadn't had this particular dessert anywhere else so maybe I just don't like the dessert but I definitely wouldn't order it again. I'd give it 4.5 stars if I could. &#160;My all-time two favorite Mexican food joints are Chipotle and El Chupacabre. &#160;Since Chipotle is a McDonald's-owned chain and located a few miles from my house and el Chupe is indepentantly owned and located in my neighborhood, I would pick the later to be the best. &#160;Pool, free jukebox, $2 Tecate, great selection of hot sauces, good prices. &#160;Be sure to get your burrito "wet". I really do love this place, but I just can't give them the best rating, because the service is terrible. They get my order wrong almost every time, which means I have to re-order, and then wait patiently while my friends get to nom away on their tasty burritos. I am always very clear to the server which item I am ordering (because I have a food allergy), and yet they always bring me a burrito filled with an ingredient I cannot eat.One of the problems is that two of the burritos on the menu are oddly named "basic" and "regular," which are suspiciously close to being synonyms. I think new items names would help, because I always order the basic, and almost always get the regular served to me.I would have given 4 stars, because well, waiting a few more minutes for a burrito isn't really that big of a deal, but last night was the kicker. My boyfriend ordered me a fake meat burrito takeout, and was told that they were out of fake meat. So, he said meatless would be fine. He got the burrito (labeled "no meat"), rode his bike home, handed me the burrito, and as I unwrapped it I was not-so-pleasantly surprised to find it stuffed with chicken!! Neither of us eats meat, so we had to toss it. What a bummer.I absolutely adore the food and margs, and the fake meat is some of the best I've ever had, but they really need to step up their game as far as service goes. Great place I would come back here anytime that is why I voted five stars. I guess I come to enjoy the company I'm with and the food. If you are going to complain about service go to place where you are paying for it or join the crowd at fast food crap shacks. The food is great the home made sauce is the best I would love to have a barrel of the salsa with pine apple in it. Very low key and inexpensive delicious Mexican food.
Why can't you access them on Google street view? It's not like it's in Medina or Yarrow Point... Weird. If I come back I'll take a picture of the exterior unless another Yelper stops by and takes the snapshot. This is a good restaurant if you're tired of the Mazatlan's, Puerto Vallarta's, and Azteca's. However, the square footage is a lot smaller. I guess people assume they'll get a table right away but in reality they'll probably have to wait if they come after 5pm. You'll get complimentary chips and salsa. If they ask you if you want guacamole keep in mind that it's an add on, not complimentary. I had the Burrita Le&#241;era. It had a little spicy kick to it. I couldn't eat all of it. It was huge! I'd really like to try the one on Alki but I think I'll wait till summertime. I decided to try this place again since we were in the neighborhood, and it was MUCH better this time around (much more like the Alki location that I know and love). The service was outstanding -once again. The Navajo torta was bland, but had good texture. The butternut squash enchilada though!! MMMMMM!!! This is one of about three vegetarian options here, but this one is the best!! Such good flavor in the sauce! Last time I was here they must have put the wrong sauce on or something because it didnt taste delicious like this did!The charred asparagus had just enough zing to make them interesting -very tasty and light. Good, fruity iced tea too. Not sweet like fruity iced teas can be sometimes.. After a burning craving for some great Tex Mex, we found ourselves at the Madison Park Cactus which really is my favorite Cactus location. &#160;It's located in the charming and quaint Madison Park area with a really nice vibe, which on a summer's night can be pretty perfect!The restaurant was packed as Cactus usually is so we spotted a table in the bar area just next to the open window which had a fantastic breeze and nice view of the Madison Park happenings. &#160;We quickly agreed this was as good as it gets. It was lovely.We started off with drinks, our friends ordering some margaritas, the Baja (with jalapenos) and some other fruity cocktails along with guacamole for our tortilla chips. The guac was pretty tasty with a nice zing to it. For food, we ordered a half order of the nachos (I am ALWAYS such a sucker for nachos) and my husband ordered the Grilled Portobello-Vegetable Escabeche Fajitas. So he has made the official claim and announcement, those fajitas were by far the best he had ever had... IN HIS LIFE. I've heard him mention the fajitas several times this morning and it's only 10AM.Busy and obsessed with my nachos which had roasted corn, melted cheese, pico de gallo, buttermilk crema, and guac I took a small bite of his fajitas and I could see why he'd make such a big important statement. The portabellas could not have been anymore well- seasoned and had a really nice and gentle kick with a touch of lime towards the end. So, Cactus - yep I'm a pretty big fan and this particular location remains to be my favorite spot, though I'm excited to see the South Lake Union digs which is opening soon.A solid spot for some fresh and tasty Tex Mex food! Very good food, very good service. &#160;We even saw the waiter at a different location a few hours later and he recognized us and thanked us again for coming in. &#160;That is dedication to service. &#160;Also, after all was said and done, the manager came over and brought us free flan. &#160;We didn't see this coming, but we definitely enjoyed it.I normally don't want to spend too much on Mexican food, and especially don't want to pay for chips and salsa, but this food was worth it and still not as much as you will pay at some sit-down Mexican places. &#160;And the chips and salsa were apparently bottomless (and didn't end up on our bill).The portions were very filling without being grossly large, but the flavors were incredible and unique. &#160;Go to Cactus, sit outside if you can, get a drink, try their specials, and enjoy yourself. This isn't your hole-in-the-wall Mexican restaurant. It's a fun, whimsical place with interesting art throughout, and a unique variety of food to match. We both had mojitos and the chile relleno (at friends' recommendation) and were completely blown away with the flavor and amount of care that went into the presentation. A big thumbs up for a night out with friends or even after a softball game as my coworkers have done plenty of times! I have been coming to Cactus for a few years now and I am always satisfied.I always start off with the house salsa &amp; guacamole and chips! The salsa is so delicious with great lime flavor. I sometimes order the lemonade with jalape&#241;o. Its very refreshing but I wish they would put more drink in the cup rather than ice. I have tried many of their dishes but my favorites are: The Mexican chop salad which has a great lime dressing and tender chicken.Chicken tacos are pretty fantastic with good fixins! My favorite I've had so far is probably the chicken chimayo. The blue-corn tortillas and green chile sauce mixed with the melted cheese was fantastic!I've also had the fry bread with honey which is pretty good. The honey and warm fry bread combo is awesome.Keep in mind this isn't Mexican. It's a Mexican/Southwest fusion so many of the dishes are not "traditional." I love Cactus. &#160;Their chips and salsa always hit the spot and I think they've got one of the best flans around. &#160;Their sangria is light and refreshing and I've tried a new dish every time I've come, and I've enjoyed each one of them thoroughly. &#160;The atmosphere is great and the decor is colorful and fun. &#160;The service has always been superb, and they let you sit and chat for a while &#160;- so you never feel like you're being rushed out of there. This is always a great option if you have a hankering for some Tex Mex. Delicioso! &#160;Cactus has a slightly different edge than the other run of the mill Mexican restaurants. &#160;Their focus is Southwest cuisine. &#160;We had a couple of popular items from the menu, although, we did see other items than sounded like they would be tasty too.1) &#160;Appetizer of Guacamole2) &#160;Appetizer of the Squash Blossoms stuffed with goat's cheese3) &#160;Sonora Spa Chicken4) &#160;Butternut Squash Enchilada5) &#160;Kid's Quesadilla with a side of grilled steak6) &#160;FlanSo let me start,,,,the salsa that they serve at the table is addictive. We loved it but were scared that we were going to get full off of eating so many of their tortilla chips. &#160;The chips were light and not greasy.Next, the guacamole looked nice. &#160;Large portion garnished nicely. &#160;However, I wasn't a big fan of this. &#160;They dilluted the avocado with something that made it less than if I would have received a smaller portion with just plain o'l avocado.I got my ice tea which was wonderful since it was the Paradise Brand...Passion Fruit. &#160;I haven't had this since the 90's, but I love it and it brought back old memories.Then, we got our squash blossoms with goat cheese. &#160;The closest similarity that came to mind was like crab rangoon, fried with creamy cheese and served over 3 different types of sauces....chipotle, a cilantro-garlic (?), and some smokey sauce. &#160;All three sauces were fine as well as the squash blossoms. &#160;The problem was that they just served 3 for that price. &#160;You could eat a whole plate/basket of these easily. &#160;It would be like serving 3 corn chips with a guacamole smear. &#160;My Sonora Spa Chicken was pretty tasty. &#160;I liked the grilled chicken along with all of the vegetables. &#160;The presentation wasn't my favorite. &#160;It tasted better than it looked.My wife's butternut squash enchilada plate was huge. &#160;It came with black beans, rice and a massive enchilada-thing. &#160;I'm usually a big, big, big fan of any type of bean. &#160;These black beans were just so-so. &#160;The rice was good mainly because they added pepitas (toasted squash seeds) which gave it a nice bite/crunch. &#160;The enchilada itself had a very hearty tasty filling of some squash and a massive portabella mushroom inside. &#160;Once again, the flavor far exceeded the presentation. &#160;From the looks, it was boring. &#160;The taste, though, was ...mejor !The kids Quesadilla was just a quesadilla. &#160;The grilled steak was some small pieces of steak meat. &#160;My daughter munched on the steak meat and polished this off.For dessert, we split a flan. &#160;Our server said that it is made with 3 types of milk giving it a thick creamy finish. &#160;Jason, our server, was right. &#160;It was delicious but tasted like it was dense in calories. &#160;Not sure, but we liked it a lot.In terms of look and feel of the restaurant, it is kind of noisy, but my daughter liked the tiger fabric used on the booth seats. &#160;The lighting was a little low. &#160;They had a kid's menu, but it felt a little bar-like. &#160;Great if you like getting alcoholic beverages and still have kids, but it didn't feel as family-like.The food overall was pretty tasty, a little pricey, and presentation could be a little better to really emphasize the quality of the meal. +1 point for decor+1 point for well cooked steak fajitas+1 point for good salsa and okay guacamole-1 point for crappy, lackluster service-1 point for no sopapillas for dessertEnded up here during restaurant week by accident. &#160;The place was understaffed for the busy Sunday afternoon crowd (1-2pm). &#160;Hostess was on the phone when we walked in (which happens) but still failed to acknowledge us until she was done (should not happen).Took a seat in the bar. &#160;Admired the decorations. &#160;Chit-chatted. &#160;Checked our phone. &#160;Started at each other. &#160;Finally had to ask the bartender for menus because we had waited 5-10 minutes and no one came by our table.Bartender came over and mumbled something about specials available for restaurant week. &#160;We ordered our drinks and food. &#160;Ice tea came without lemon (not a hard garnish, right?) and no offer for sweetener (it's not rocket science - at least offer it). &#160;Free chips and salsa and not-free guacamole came out, later fajitas came out. &#160;Steak was well cooked. &#160;One order of fajitas was plenty for two people. &#160;Burned through the tortillas quickly (why do restaurants only serve you three tortillas? &#160;People always want more). &#160;Had to get someone else to bring us tortillas. &#160;Paid, left.With all that said, I would go back. &#160;The Yelp review say that Cactus is usually pretty good. &#160;I could tell they were slammed, and for the most part the staff was busting their butts to get to all the tables. &#160;They had a decent selection of vegetarian options that included vegetables (as opposed to just cheese enchiladas). &#160;The service today was just. so. missing. I ordered a Margarita with Grand Marnier and a Cinnamon-sugar salt rim. It was a very unique cocktail and very tasty!I ordered something on the specials menu. I forget what it was called but it had eggs, cornmeal and steak with potatoes on the side and it was delicious. I'm normally not rude at the table, but if my girlfriend would have asked for a bite, I would have said "No!"A manager brought us some complimentary flan because it was our first time. The flan was very good and we were impressed that he brought it.We'll definitely come back. The (formerly) $10 Nachos are the best you will EVER have on the planet. Split between two people with a mojito or two each is the perfect Friday after work.Add the meat to the nachos, so good! My husband and I went here for my birthday dinner. The staff were great, especially our waitress, Cynara, who was very friendly and attentive without hovering like a seagull. The food was very good, but don't go expecting your typical Mexican/American food. There is a big emphasis on cumin, which I am not a huge fan of, but the food was done well, and I still enjoyed it. The Hibiscus Chi Chi is to DIE for if you are a Girl Drink Drunk such as myself, and the Bananas Dulce was so good I wanted to take it home to meet my parents. This is a great place for a classy but casual evening and the prices are decent. Love Love Love Cactus! Went for the first time on Saturday and enjoyed dinner on the patio. Our food took a little longer than I would have liked but was enjoying the sun (WTF is that?), a mojito, the delicious salsa, and amazing dinner company.Sampled both the chicken tacos and the chicken chimichanga. Both were delicious! I can't wait to go back and try the butternut squash enchiladas. :)After we finished the manager came out and welcomed us with a complimentary flan. Can't beat that!! Food is good. Chips and Salsa plus Guacamole cost $6, instead of free in other Mexican restaurant. &#160;They also don't refill the chips. &#160;We had Fajita (beef) and Green enchilada, both are well made and tasted fresh. &#160;The Cactus Margarita came in a simple glass, a bit on the sweet side and too much salt on the rim.Overall atmosphere relaxing and nice. &#160;It is hard to feel real Mexican in Seattle. &#160;On this sunny Sunday lunch, it gets pretty close here.It is a bit far to drive and parking is street only. &#160;Service was a bit slow, but not unbearable. My experience here was decent. &#160;I came with a friend for lunch on a weekday. &#160;Being from Texas, I search out places in Seattle that offer Tex-Mex cuisine. &#160;Honestly, this place isn't it. &#160;The service was excellent. &#160;The food itself was passable, but unremarkable. &#160;I would liken it to something you'd find in Arizona more than Texas for New Mexico. &#160;Again, it wasn't bad, just unremarkable. &#160;It was fairly bland, and while everything tasted fairly fresh, it lacked any zing to speak of. &#160;If you're looking for low-key Mexican food, this isn't a bad place. Went here for the first time today, the staff was fantastic. &#160;I work in food service and it's difficult for me to muster up enthusiasm, but these people seems genuinely excited about the food and their roles as hosts. &#160;got the most delicious chimichanga. &#160;guacamole was great, they made our first time experience well worth it. The brisket tacos are amazing! &#160;I tried the seafood enchilada my wife had, it was so good I finished it for her. &#160;Definitely going back. I cannot say enough good things about this place. Cactus has become my must-go-at-least-once spot everytime I find myself in Seattle. &#160;The food is impressive, but the service makes this place THE place to eat in a city full of great dining. If it's nice outside, wait for an outdoor table! Nothing beats just hanging out enjoying the food and watching the Madison Park craziness.Not sure when I'll be back in Seattle, but I know where I'll be headed first! Stellar experience. The salsa was really good, the jalapeno poppers, spicy as hell &amp; so good.Our server was super nice, as well as the manager, and they gave us free dessert for no reason other than we'd never been here before. &amp; let me tell you, that free flan was pretty fucking good.They seem to have their customer service down pat. &amp; I feel I should mention that even though it was a busy Friday night, the bartenders were great, friendly, &amp; fast while we waited at the bar for a table. I came here with my Mom not too long ago and really enjoyed it. I had an awesome waiter and the food was service was pretty quick. As far as food is concerned, it was really good for a Mexican joint. And that's a lot coming from me, &#160;considering I've gotten food poisoning twice in my life from Mexican food. Definitely recommend this place for anyone who finds themselves in Madison Park. Awesome restaurant. Great food, great drinks, good vibe in a good location in Madison Park. I have high standards for tex-mex after living in Austin, Texas for 3 years - this place was among the best since I left Texas.Service is also impeccable: our food took quite a bit of time to arrive since we got there in a bad time when many new folks had just seated. Without us saying a word, the manager came to our table to apologize and gave us a desert to take home. That's what I call good service, we'll be back. My God...this place can do NO wrong. &#160;My boyfriend and I went down to celebrate out anniversary because it is our favorite place to go..and again, it was amazing. &#160;I had the Chile Relleno with coconut rice, which I could eat everyday. &#160;I don't know what in the world they put in that thing, but is is one of the best meals I have ever had. &#160;Not to mention the chips and salsa they start you out with..they are always wonderful. Really the best I have ever had. My boyfriend had the Chicken fried chicken..which was also phenomenal. &#160;The service, as always..great. &#160;We love this place and will remain loyal customers forever! This place is fantastic! &#160;It was our first visit, and the staff was friendly and welcoming. &#160;They were very informative and helpful with questions about the menu. &#160; Everything from the salsa and chips to the desert were fantastic! &#160;I could not get enough. &#160;I left stuffed, but still wanting to eat more of their food. &#160;Delicious! &#160;Their margaritas are good... perfect for a hot day. &#160;I will be going back soon. :) My then-boyfriend worked here for a summer and he'd rave about the food (and occasionally bring some home to entice me) so I finally broke down and went to visit him. So glad I did! The food here is delightful. The guacamole, the fry bread, the steak salad and especially - especially! - the butternut squash enchilada. Everything I've tried, I loved. The cocktails are inspired and tasty as well.Unfortunately I haven't been here since then-boyfriend left and we stopped getting sweet hook-ups but with the new happy hour, I might just return! I came here with friends for a light dinner. &#160;First mistake was thinking that Tex-Mex would somehow pass off as light food. &#160;But, that didn't matter. &#160;I ordered a Pineapple Margarita which was delicious. &#160;For dinner, I ordered the chicken chimichanga. &#160;The chimichanga was packed with chicken, slathered in jack cheese. &#160;The chicken wasn't at all greasy, which was great. &#160;It came with black beans, rice, guacamole and sour cream. &#160;The chicken itself was moist and cooked well. &#160;Overall, I wouldn't say it was anything extraordinary, but they definitely did execute the dish just fine. &#160;The portion of the dish was perfect with relation to how much you pay (a little under $15 for my plate of food).The atmosphere was nice. &#160;We chose to sit outside. &#160;The table wasn't that huge, but for the size of the plates and glasses everything fit just fine. &#160;The service was fine and our waiter was very pleasant.If you're in the Madison Park area and are looking to try out other restaurants along the East Madison Street strip, this place would be worthy of your money. I LOVE CACTUS! Madison Park is my Favorite one! This is the second time Im raving about this place. Im never disappionted and the service is always above and beyond. I sat at the bar with a girfriend and even though the bartendar was slammed we never felt neglected! He was fantastic! The boss man also stepped in when it was especially chaotic! Great Place!! Host/ess: 3.0Wait person: 3.3Food; Taste, Presentation: 3.0Property: &#160;Ambiance, Style, Decor: 3.0 Cactus has become part of the regular rotation for dinner out.Why?Cactus Margaritas with saltThe best damn chips and salsa in townTortilla Soup that I will scarf down in the middle of summer when it's 100 degrees outA steak salad that &#160;made me like salads. &#160;Mixed greens tossed with seared skirt steak, sliced avocado, blue cheese, pico de gallo and other yumminess. &#160;A flan that puts other custard desserts to shame.All that deliciousness served by an attentive and friendly staff.Pity that the nice weather makes for a 30+ min wait, but there are plenty of places nearby to walk to / drink in while you wait. Well, *they* remodeled and I re-ordered. See what a bitch I really am for my prior review.Now, while I miss the charm of the old bar. I don't get fucking hit time and again with crammed two tops. XO to CactusGo for the steak or chicken salads people. A+ When I first visited Seattle, before I moved here, my friends took me to Cactus. Being from Southern California I am very familiar with Mexican/Tex-Mex food but Cactus raises the bar on creativity and adding new flair to tex-mex. This visit I had Seafood enchiladas and man they were good! Nice flavor perfectly cooked, the black beans and rice were made well also. I also order the Sangria, very tasty. My Mom had the special blackened chicken tamales and they were phenomenal! Great spice and flavor and was laid in a lake of a sweet corn relish sauce, really good also. To cap the meal off we ordered two orders of churros, with dipping sauces of a mexican carmel, a dark chocolate sauce (reminiscent of Bosco,) and a coconut whipped cream, which was absolutely amazing! Just a great meal every time. I like Cactus. &#160;I came with a friend and we sat outside which was great for people watching on a nice summer evening. I liked the feel of the inside too. &#160;It is good for louder groups or a casual date (esp if you sit outside). &#160;I ordered a veggie enchilada that no longer appears to be on the menu, but it was good.I really wanted to try the cocktails and desserts and other dishes such as the seafood enchilada, butternut squash enchilada, cuban flan and bananas dulce. &#160;I am really excited for the Lake Union location to open especially since they will have happy hour there. &#160;Either way, I will be back to one of these two locations! The chop salad really hit it out of the park for me, will be back.One of the best uses of that southwestern flavor I have enjoyed in some time. I can really only root for the food here. I've been to the seattle location twice and once in kirkland. They have an interesting drink menu too.The service is horrible (atleast at the seattle location). Went on a Wednesday night and it was busy (WTF?) As soon as we step in, there's one person waiting at the door and the hostess(es?) are no where to be found. One person who i believe to be a hostess walks right by with out a "hello" or a "i'll be right w/ you". I only see one table in the bar area and don't want to miss out on it because another couple has already walked in behind us and we're all considereing how long of a wait it will be for a table. (this place isn't worth the wait)We're finally told we can grab the last empty table and wait... and wait.... for someone to bring menu, water, etc.Eventually all of our dining needs are met, but i feel this took twice as long as it should have. It's not like they were understaffed. I often saw staff standing by those order registers talked to eachother instead of helping.oh well. one less reason to go to Madison area restaurants. I live very close to this marvelous establishment which allows me to frequent it often. Awesome margaritas, wonderful chips and guacamole, and hearty, innovative and inspired spanish dishes keep most everyone in Madison Park coming back so often, it is often very difficult to get a table!!!Great place to eat, drink an be merry. The food here is amazing, and the veggie burrito that they have on the lunch menu is also order-able for dinner, and it's FANTASTIC. And really quite beautiful, actually. Like you feel a bit mean for ruining the presentation.The service, however, is sometimes inconsistent. Sometimes phenomenal, sometimes less than stellar, but with potential.One time, we came here and ordered two vegetarian items, but received a chicken and a prawn instead. After we noted the mistake, our meal was complementary, as were drinks, copious amounts of guac and dessert. Yay!On Mother's Day, we went there for dinner around 6, expecting the usual wait. The girl curtly said it would be an hour for a party of five. Accepting this, we walked around, and then came back to wait for about 20 minutes. To our disgust, there were open booths, tables and tables that could be slid together to accommodate us everywhere. There were four booths open.So we waited... the full hour. Then our buzzer rang and we sat at the booths we had been waiting for, and watching. The same booths that remained empty the whole time were were there. And when we left. Bummer. Apparently though, you can call ahead to get your name on the list to lessen your wait.Tasty food, try the nachos for an appetizer because who doesn't adore a big plop of guac around some tasty covered chips? Cute, expensive, small place. The food is pretty good but be prepared to wait a long while for a table and there are so few and this is a popular joint. The service is top notch, however. There was some kind of chipotle brownie dessert that we had and it was sinful. Very good. I'll probably be back if I can find parking and don't have to wait an hour for a table. Cactus has many items on its menu that I would say are the best in their category in the city. &#160;They have the best mojitos (all the flavors are good, pomegranate and mango are my favorite, but you'll be missing out if you don't try the coconut at least once), the best tamales (go early though, tamales are usually one of the specials and they run out quickly), the best salad (their Mexican Chop Salad), etc. &#160;Of all these bests, the best of the best are their chorizo nachos. It's hard to mess up nachos so there are plenty of places to get decent or even good ones. &#160;In fact even the fast food world offers some pretty good nachos. &#160;However, if you want the best you'll go to Cactus and order the chorizo. &#160;I can't put my finger on what exactly makes these nachos superior. &#160;Maybe it's the sauce. &#160;Instead of sour cream they put buttermilk crema on their nachos and it is delicious. &#160;It could also be the chorizo. &#160;I've had chorizo nachos other places and they haven't been as good, but Cactus makes their own chorizo so that may give them an edge. &#160;Whether it's the sauce or the chorizo or some combination of other factors, I can assure you these are the best nachos you will ever taste. &#160;You'll need at least 2-3 people to finish a full order of them but luckily they also offer half orders. I can honestly say i've never been disappointed with Cactus EVER and i've been hundreds of times. I used to frequent the Kirkland one when i lived there. I was pleasantly surprised when I moved to Madison Park to find another down there as well! It's definitely one of my favorite Mexican restaurants. It's more Tex mex than anything - not that greasy drowned in cheese type mexican food. This place serves fresh, delicious and interesting plates. Butternut Squash Enchilada.. never even thought of putting those together but it's to die for! So delicious! The green enchilada is one of my personal favorites, along with their steak tacos. They always cook their steak to perfection, never dry or over done and the meal comes with all the toppings your appetite desires to make up your own tacos. The Prickley Pear Margarita is a MUST, along with their Guacamole, it ranks top 3 in best Guac i've ever had! The decor is funky and cool. Zebra striped booths, light up lanterns hanging from the ceilings. It's a great spot for HH, a date or just some drinks with free chips and salsa! Doesn't get much better than Cactus!! I was here on 5-26-11.Me &amp; all of my co-workers in my unit came here to celebrate one of colleagues retirement. My boss chose this picked this place because he had been here before, but no one else knew what to expect because this was our first time here.The first thing you notice when you walk inside is how beautiful this place is! I love the decorations, etc &amp; felt completely comfortable from the minute I walked in. FYI when you walk in the bar is to your right, &amp; the restrooms are staight ahead.Anyhow, we were seated with the rest of our party immediately, &amp; we started to order drinks as soon as all of our party had arrived. I had a Long Island Iced Tea, which was very good &amp; strong. All pluses! They are very attentive to what their customer wants, etc. I never felt a feeling of "where's the waiter?", "where's my food?" etc. Next we were served chips &amp; salsa. Yummy.They took their time ordering our entrees for us, &amp; we received them with no issues. My food (the butternut squash) was not very good to me however. It's a vegan version of enchiladas, &amp; was too spicy IMO. One of my co-workers who had ordered the same thing, didn't like her meal either, &amp; she had ordered the same thing as me.The place is kept clean. The size is about a medium sized restaraunt. Despite not having the best meal, I'd still give the place a second shot. I highly recommend the green enchilada. &#160;This is the best item on their menu. The staff is always nice, even when they are super busy (which is always).Cactus is a Madison Park institution - and for good reason. The best mexican food AND service we've had in a very long time. The waitress was excellent! The decorations are gaudi like many Mexican restaurants, but very endearing and actually added to the experience. The waitress asked if it was our first time and was thereafter extremely helpful and forthcoming with suggestions. My husband got the Ancho Roasted Pork Pibil and I got the butternut squash Enchiladas - both were AMAZING! Not to mention the watermelon and cucumber margarita and their signature award wining margarita - delicious and refreshing- everything high quality. Then, to make things even better, the manager brought out a surprise flan and thanked us for coming to his restaurant. It was very, very nice - a very personal experience. We will be back many more times. I was totally, completely impressed. WONDERFUL food and excellent drinks. But really, the dealmaker was the service. Our server was the best I can remember in a long time...maybe ever. He was not over the top or false...just really excellent. He actually treated waitering like the art it can be. We felt welcomed and will definitely be back.
Things to like about this place: homemade guacamole; 2 varieties of tasty salsa; real, live plants all around; service with a smile; purposeful vegetarian options (not always easy to find in a Mexican joint); sticky, sweet sopapillas; and a $7.95 buffet. For that price, it doesn't need to be 5-star. I'll be back! Amazing staff. Awesome atmosphere. The food sadly is not the best Mexican I've ever had. I only recommend this place for drinks and snacks. Great for large groups. Yeah every Sunday for the last 4yrs. Believe it. This place is kind of an odd duck as far as a 1-5 rating, so I guess it depends on what you want:Eating here? Pass. I've ... well, I've seen some interesting decisions being made here. My definition of a chicken quesadilla isn't a pile of chicken folded in a tortilla, then cheese sprinkled on top and thrown in the broiler. At least I think that's what it was. Either way the quality was nothing to write home about. Maybe if I'd already had a few drinks, which does bring me neatly to my second point.Drinking here with some friends? Yes. Great place to bring in a group of people, because their service has always been on the ball, friendly, and fast. Definitely the high point. Nobody I've been with has complained about their drinks, ever. This is in stark contrast to the food.The problem is, while their service is top notch, and their drinks are good, in the end it's a restaurant and I consider ordering food to be fairly important at a restaurant. I can get good margaritas with slightly worse service but unbelievably better food elsewhere. Their beans may be vegetarian, but the RICE IS NOT! It's made with chicken stock--veggies beware! Sunday night, we decided to try La Cocina &amp; Cantina for a quick bite. It was pretty busy! We decided to have Nachos and Mexican pizza. Both very good, but the portions were too big just for the two of us. We had not been here in a long time and we will definitely remember this place for our late snacks! I LOVE LOVE LOVE their Shrimp/Crab chimichanga. &#160;My friend LOVES their buffet.Always great service, always a place to sit and family-friendly. I stopped in for their buffet at 3:50 hoping I'd still made it as I know it's over at 4. The gentleman said sure and I was seated quickly. It isn't the best Mexican food in town but the staff is so friendly that I'll be back. Just like the SNL skit "I gotta have more cowbell" ---"I gotta have more chips!" &#160;I came here with a party of 4 and we finished our 1st basket of tortilla chips. &#160;When our server stopped by I asked if he could bring us more chips. &#160;He said the cook in the back couldn't make anymore. &#160;I gave him the "REALLY?!" look (confused and shocked)--the one where I'm thinking "Wow, I'm in a restaurant and they don't want to serve us food." &#160;He studied my facial expression. &#160;He was a good sport so he said "Hold on, I'll check in the back and see what I can do." &#160;Within 10 minutes he brought back freshly made tortilla chips. My wife and I stopped in here a week ago while walking around Capital Hill. &#160;We managed to walk in towards the end of the lunch buffet. &#160;The overall low rating was really a mixed review. &#160;I thought the price for the lunch buffet was very reasonable, probably even low for the type of buffet that was served. &#160;The food was a bit average. &#160;They served some thin tortilla chips that didn't have enough taste to it. &#160;I prefer the thicker chips that are well salted. &#160;The reason for my low rating is not because of the food or service, it was the men's bathroom. &#160;It was disgusting! &#160;I won't go into detail, but don't use the bathroom if you can help it. &#160;It I hadn't used it, I probably would have given this place a 3 or 4 star rating. Meh. &#160;That about sums it up. &#160;Wasn't good. &#160;Wasn't bad. &#160; Margarita was good. &#160;$1.50 charge for sour cream was a little excessive. &#160;Service was slow- we had a wait a bit for our check. Just average. &#160;I wasn't at all impressed. Love this place! &#160;Their menu is awesome, they prepare the food quickly and well, it's delicious, and the prices are good! You can't help but want endless amount of their tasty complimentary tortilla chips and two sauces they give you before your food arrives!I go there maybe once or twice per month and the staff always remember me, it's nice! &#160;My friend and I always go here to catch up because of their food and massive margaritas! I have never had a bad experience there and their food is great! They also have a huge margarita menu...and they have some great specials on different days of the week. Their enchiladas and burritos are tasty and full of flavor! &#160;If you want some great south of the border eats with friendly service and for a good price then check out La Cocina...and while you're at it, drink up on their margaritas because it's just about guaranteed that you will have some left overs to bring home!
I had been holding off on visiting Bastille for months - every time I thought of going, someone would mention that their food was "so-so" or the service was "meh." &#160;Reading some of the review on Yelp just made me more sluggish about checking it out. &#160;But my husband and I finally decided to try dinner there New Year's Day, and wow, what a pleasant surprise! &#160;Lovely, knowledgable service. &#160;Great attention to detail with the decor, and a fun vibe. &#160;And the food - yum! &#160;We tried a couple of specials - kohlrabi soup with lobster and a hash with Brussels sprouts - which were both just perfect in execution and portion size. &#160;Got the "basic" garden salad, which I thought would be kind of boring, but was amazingly fresh and enjoyable to eat. &#160;Predictably, the French onion soup and steak frites were delicious. &#160;Not as predictable was the peanut butter ice cream, which didn't really make sense (when I lived in France nobody ate peanut butter, or could even purchase it), but was amazing enough to be inhaled by me and my husband within seconds.Bottom line: &#160;this place is worth checking out. &#160;Maybe they have worked out their service and kitchen kinks, or maybe my friends and fellow Yelpers are just too darn picky. &#160;Personally, I loved it and plan to come back soon. Like their menu says..."Damn good French food." We arrived at 6pm without a reservation so we were seated in the bar area in the back. It worked out well because the vibe was livelier than the front and suited us well.All their food is local and they even grow many of their veggies on their rooftop garden; hard to believe with Seattle's lack of sun but they promise it's up there (although they wouldn't show us..hmmm). They have a really good happy-hour appetizer selection for $5 and we chose the mussells and I cannot recommend them enough. They were very fresh and didn't have too much butter on them. Also, the serving was large for $5.For my main I had the sea bass which was the nights special. It was very good but I could have used twice the amount of fish...although what do I expect from a French restaurant? My uncle both had the beet salad with chevre and said it was very good. Cheers Atmosphere - checkFood - checkService - checkBastille has been on my list of restaurants to try for quite some time. &#160;I've read mixed reviews, but I finally decided to give it a go. &#160; They are obviously trying to go for the Paris Bistro feel and they full it off. &#160;Most restaurants that try this usually end up feeling like an Disney Epcot version. &#160;The service was very attentive without feeling intrusive. &#160;If you needed something, the wait staff would be strolling by in a few minutes. &#160;I never had that dreadful feeling of being ignored.The food, oh the food. &#160;The food is simple, but very well executed. &#160;I had a pork belly with apples and picked onions. &#160;It had very few components but was just done perfectly. &#160;Isn't that what simple food is all about? &#160;My wife had the steak frites with roquefort. &#160;The steak, while not being a monster like you'd get from a steak place, was extremely tasty and actually cooked to medium. &#160;Why is it that I can get a steak cooked to the exact temperature that we ordered at a French style bistro, but not at a steak restaurant? &#160;The fries were really well done. &#160;Perfectly crispy on the outside, silky smooth inside and seasoned with plenty of salt.I had the cassoulet for dinner. &#160;Cassoulet is one of those dishes that I am powerless to resist when it's on a menu. &#160;Duck confit, sausage, pork, and white beans, what's not to like? &#160;Theirs didn't disappoint. &#160;Taste and texture were spot on. &#160;We had the tarte tatin for dessert. &#160;Wow! &#160;I don't use exclamation points lightly, but this stuff was fantastic. &#160;Buttery pastry with perfectly cooked apples and ice cream. &#160;I usually don't expect much when I order dessert, but the tarte tatin was just great.Cafe Campagne used to be our go-to French place. No longer. Good food and great cocktails combined with classy barmen. &#160;Cocktails: &#160;I had the "Bicycle" (i don't pretend to write french) cos of the combo of Gin and St. Germain, it was a very well made/thought out drink. &#160;My girlfriend had the Rosemary Lemonade, also very nice.Dinner/Bar Apps: &#160;Baguette with butter from Grand Central = grand central bakery is fantastic. &#160;Rabbit "Galette", this was the highlight of the night, really tasty. &#160;the only negative on the rabbit was the girlfriend got two little chipped bones which goes with the territory when dealing with rabbit. The larger potatoes it was served with seemed slightly undercooked.Gnocchi - they were good, we both lived in Italy for 4 years so it was our mistake to think they were going to be Italian gnocchi.Lentils - I love lentils and these could have been excellent but they seemed about 5 minutes from perfectly cooked.Though, i don't know how the french do lentils so maybe they were just right. &#160;***Props to the prep guy who did an amazing amount of work to get tiny, tiny square "soffritto" as the veggie base for the lentils.A very good meal and great service at the bar top by Deveaux, the barman and Charles, the bar manager.Thanks, will definitely be back. I want to LOVE Bastille. I want to share my commitment and desire for a long-lasting friendship. I want it to be the go-to place for those "Date Night With Myself" evenings where I relax comfortably at the bar and get my best people watching game on. I want them to eventually get my name spelled correctly when I call and make reservations.So Bastille has the potential to be all of this but last Saturday, which was unofficially called "Date Night With Four of My Girlfriends," most everything fell flat.They stuck us in a booth in the back of the restaurant right by the kitchen. The only thing I enjoyed about this was being close to all of the good-looking male staff. It was otherwise very uncomfortable, cramped, and loud.We received our drinks about 30 minutes after we were seated &#160;as we didn't get to put in our order until the 20 minute mark. Our waitress was more attentive to the weird man dressed as court jester sipping on martinis (no joke) than she was to us. &#160;We had to flag her down for just about everything.Lastly there is the food. I must admit.... they do some pretty impressive things in that kitchen of theirs. I had the falafel wrap with salade verte. Other plates served at our table included the lamb burger and frites, magret de canard (duck), coquilles st-jacque (scallops), courge roti (roasted squash). All very tasty dishes. None of the ladies complained, everyone raved. Yum. Holiday Cheer.So my reviews are mixed. I'm not swearing off Bastille because of how fantastically gorgeous it is in there and how fantastically gorgeous it makes me feel. It's not too bad on the pocket-book and at least I'll get a decent meal out of it no matter the other inconsistencies. I love that their menu is organic and sustainable. Especially because my allergies are such (chemicals murder me) that it makes eating out really hard sometimes.The happy hour at Bastille is spectacular. Tasty bites for a reasonable price. If it's still on the menu, I recommend the squash and the mussels. Both were wonderful and light.The breakfast there was very good (Sundays). Not the best eggs benedict I've ever had, but very good nonetheless. Also, when you order a side of bacon, a LOT of bacon comes out. Everyone at the table got to wear the "bacon face" (something of a hybrid between "Duhhhhhhhhh" and an Orgasm).Our waiter was very friendly, and helpful with suggestions. I'd definitely suggest Bastille for anyone, but especially those concerned about what ingredients go down the gullet. After a long day of doing absolutely nothing, we started out here for HH. &#160;My intention was stay through dinner and actually try some entrees, but we didn't get there. &#160;Mussels in a curry (that reminded me of a dish my mom used to make using geoduck), a simply outstanding lamb burger, bread, olives and frites g0t us sated and happy. &#160;Throw in a couple rounds of bee's knees and we were good to go. &#160;We sat on the side, in the covered area and it never really got busy. &#160;When I go again, I want to sit inside and people watch more. &#160;The back bar, by the restrooms was full, though.I almost knocked this down a half star, because the staff was not friendly at all. &#160;It was strictly, take our order and walk away. &#160;No conversation or checking in on us at all. &#160;For such a fun place, I expected a little better. Tried Bastille again last night.I'm still sticking with a solid three stars, but I had a better experience this time than last (although I also decided to forgo dessert here and hit the gelato place down the block instead after last time's disappointing dessert). &#160;We arrived about 6PM and the bar was hopping but most of the tables were still empty. &#160;That said, is was pretty darn loud in there. &#160;Once the tables filled in the noise level ratcheted up to the point where I had to keep leaning over to hear what my friend was saying. &#160;I love the decor of Bastille, but it might be worth looking into adding some sort of "soft" accoutrements to dampen the noise. &#160;Bastille is one of the places in Seattle that is now charging for bread, but it is good bread. &#160;Menu description: "GRAND CENTRAL BAGUETTE $3 with Plugr&#225; butter &amp; sea salt. Semolina baguette with a classic crust served with European-style creamery butter. We're happy to refill the basket at no additional cost." Honestly, we refilled the basket once and both enjoyed the baguette so much that it was indeed worth paying for bread. &#160;I ordered the confit de canard (Crispy duck leg with red wine braised cabbage &amp; lardons) and it was one of the better confits I have enjoyed. &#160;I'll be back for the confit, as man cannot live on bread alone (HAHAHAHA, uh, sorry for the digression....). My friend ordered the cassoulet (White bean stew, duck confit, Toulouse sausage &amp; pork shoulder) so the emerging theme for the evening was ducks and pigs. &#160;I has a bite of his and it was quite good. &#160;The one place where Bastille stands out is in their cocktail menu. &#160;I enjoyed La Muse (Vodka, grapefruit &amp; Cassis with a splash of Cr&#233;mant, served on the rocks) so much that I ordered another. &#160;My friend tried the French (Gin, Champagne, lemon &amp; sugar) and proclaimed it delicious. The menu says "damn good French cuisine" and they're spot on. &#160;First, the Ballard area is just cool - a great vibe and charming town feel. &#160;Second, the room at Bastille is fantastic; in fact, I'd go to their website and read about the design touches before you go so you can appreciate them.Food is French bistro fare at its best. &#160;I was here for a biz dinner, and the group had steak frites, sandwich au confit du porc, fricasse de poulet and the cassoulet (my pick). &#160;Can't speak for the other dishes, but my dining companions devoured every bite. &#160;The cassoulet was outstanding and a nice fit for 42 degrees outside and rain (in other words, April in Seattle).Our server was attentive without being overbearing, showed up at just the right times and gave us a lot of space to enjoy our dinner. &#160;Nice, nice wine list, good beers.Only word of advice is that Ballard is a very popular area and parking is at a premium, but it is well worth it to sample Bastille. &#160;It's officially a "favorite haunt" after one visit. Yumm, definitely a place to come back to... We had a party of 6 with a reservation around 10am on Sunday morning for brunch. We weren't aware of the farmer's market going on since we don't live in the relative area so that made parking a little troublesome but nothing worth avoiding this place for. We had reservations and still had to wait about 5-10 min for our table but it was fine, pleasantly we were seated in the outdoor covered patio, the heat lamps did get to be a bit overbearing as it was coming right down on your face but it even'd out after a bit. The coffee is very strong plus for me but a warning for those of you looking for a weaker companion. We did have a child with us and as its not particularly geared toward children (no specific kids menu) it was still quite nice.The food was delish and all of us were happy with our selections and the portions were plentiful.Definitely worth trying out. Had an amazing dinner at Bastille this week. &#160;I never go wrong when ordering from the plat de jour menu. &#160;I am totally obsessed with the house made cheese that was paired with rooftop arugula and pickled beets, it was so light but creamy at the same time. &#160;They need to start selling this cheese!We also had the salmon special which lasted about two minutes at our table. &#160;It came with smoked oyster mushrooms, bok choy and a green garlic broth. &#160;If I could do it over again, I wouldn't share this dish, I would eat it all myself.I can't wait to get back and see what they do with all the spring veggies! I really like that the restaurants in ballard have curtains behind the entry way so you see the atmosphere after you walkin. &#160;I tried the mussels and fries here and they are really good! &#160;Service was slow that night because we were seated at the bar even though we made reservations that night. There is also a downstairs also that is more publike. &#160;I would like to come back just because there aren't many french restaurants around here that are as affordable and classy as this place. :) I went to Bastille for the first time with a friend last night. It was amazing! I really loved the atmosphere. It feels like a cozy Parisian restaurant down the street. We were in there late around 10pm to let the busy dinner crowd die down a bit. Our sever was excellent and the food was exactly what we wanted! I ordered the Moules Frites and it was wonderful! I can't wait to go back and try other items on the menu. I also really enjoyed the chalkboard menu of what ingredients were currently being offered fresh from the rooftop garden. The only reason I hesitate to give 5 stars is because we walked in and had to wait around for the host to appear. He had to seat a table prior to seating us and it was a little awkward at first, standing there wondering if anyone was going to help us. Very, very good. 40 min wait w/o reservations on a Sat nite. Bar was packed, we waited down the street and called when table was ready---how's that for service?Hubs started with frog's legs special---came with a dill sauce and was very good. I felt apps were rather high in price---green salad for $9? Maybe its enough for a small entree, I don't know. I had the loup de mer, and even though a very thin filet, it was not overcooked. Came with lots of beets. It was very nice. Hubs had steak w/Roquefort, it was perfectly cooked. Again, I think they charged him $2 for about 3 tablespoons of aioli. Dining companions had the falalfel and the grilled sandwich, they appeared to enjoy them. I would def return bc of the fun atmosphere and service. Def worth it. Cool spot! I love how charming it is. Looks like a great place to go on a date. I went here last night for the first time, although we didn't eat here, we did grab some drinks at the bar. The place is dimly lit, spacious, really nice. The prices are alright (for drinks), the bartender are very very friendly, and I would definitely come back here to try some food next time. We took a look at their food menu and saw some dishes around us and it looked very tasty! I had heard great things about Bastille Cafe as a brunch spot in Ballard. &#160;And at first after my dish, I was a little disappointed. &#160;But the remnants of the Dining Diva's brunch gave me a glimpse into why people have such positive reactions. &#160;I am sure that it is a place we will be revisiting, especially when we have family in town. &#160;Next time, I just might have to be a little better in my food selection.For the full review and pictures, check out http://deckonfood.com/?p&#8230; I really wanted to like this place. The interior was fantastic, as was the atmosphere. Unfortunately, that's where the good ends. I had the cured salmon with soft boiled eggs, Flanchet de boeuf, and buttermilk sherbet for dessert. The salmon was not good at all; I had about two pieces and left it at that. The egg had so much salt on it that I could barely taste the egg, and the steak was overcooked. I will say that the steak came with mushrooms covered with a dijon sauce which were fantastic. The buttermilk sherbet was oddly sour.For the price, the food was not worth it. I've been here a number of times and always seem to have the most enjoyable visits sitting at the bar. The bartenders are friendly, just as knowledgeable as the servers about the food, and are god damn cocktail artists. The food is phenomenal - Very hard to pick a "wrong" dish. Basically if you don't like Bastille than you can go kick rocks. The environment is alive and energetic. &#160; Without a reservation we had to wait at the bar which was just fine. &#160;Great after work dinner place, looking forward to returning.However, for the price, I was not blown away by the meal. &#160;I probably just ordered the wrong thing. &#160;I had been craving a steak for a week and when I saw it on the menu it just seemed like a great choice.Don't get me wrong, the steak was a tasty piece of meat. It was good but for the price, I was expecting just a little bit more. &#160;On my plate was a $3 - $4 cut of prime sirloin, $1 of Rockford cheese and $1 worth of French Fries for $24. &#160;The Aioli was very, very nice.I'm looking forward to going back; I will try something more "French" like the rabbit. &#160;The lamb burger was a hit at our table.Pros: &#160;Classy and energetic environment. &#160;High quality food and drinks. Cons: &#160;Some menu items may be over priced. I love the energy of this restaurant. &#160;It is a romantic and lively place with delicious food and drinks. &#160;The staff is friendly and unpretentious. &#160;The Steak Frites was really yummy and I will definitely order the Bee's Knees (gin, fresh lemon and honey) again. The top of Bastille's one-page menu says it best: "Damn good French cuisine." My wife and I have been to Bastille probably 7-8 times, and we love it. The food is always fantastic (creative, fresh, well cooked and properly seasoned), the cocktails very tasty. It's both a great happy hour or a let's-go-out-for-dinner destination. Honestly, I've never even liked French Onion soup, but Bastille has made me a believer. If it's available, fall over yourself to order it. Seriously. I'm not joking. You won't be disappointed. What's robbing Bastille of it's 5th star is its construction. Its interior is beautiful, but they didn't 'pad' any surfaces, leading to a very loud dining experience when it's a full house. I can't say that I've been to a louder restaurant. Also, the service is *usually* good, but a few times it's been mediocre. Other than those two mostly minor nits, Bastille is the real deal in French cruisine. The Recessionista's Trip to FranceI've always wanted to go to France. So far, a lack of money (and a dream guy for a trip to the most romantic get-away in the world) have gotten in the way. In the meantime, I'll be visiting Bastille. Many times. :) I went on a Sunday night with a few of my girlfriends. We arrived early (5:30ish) and were seated right away. It seemed like we beat the rush--it was pretty crowded by 7:00. I had a wonderfully simple salad made with greens grown at Bastille, toasted hazelnut and fresh parmesan (so delicious &#160;that I actually ate the whole thing and only took a few bites of my incredible meal!). For dinner, I had steak and frites (the quintessential French dish, naturally). I took most of it home and the steak was still perfect on day two. The only downside? Paying for bread and butter (I hate being nickeled and dimed by restaurants!). But if I were Jean Valjean, this is the kind of bread and butter that would be worth jailtime. Delish! The atmosphere was cozy--I loved the lighting and vintage French vibe. I did notice a few kids. I wouldn't recommend it as a kids' place for dinner, though. Let the grown-ups have their fun and their romance. It is France, after all, right? ;) My friend and I were in Ballard last night all dressed up and were looking for a little more swanky place for a drink, we came across Bastille Cafe &amp; Bar. It is a quaint restaurant and bar with a fun French flair. The design of the bar is gorgeous, with a steel bar and what looks to be an old fashion mantel painted black with great detail. There is also a table with a fire pit in the middle. The bar menu is amazing with many different types of champagne and exquisite french cocktails. We were not hungry but I did notice the menu with looked very yummy, plus I am a fan of steak and frites, which the person next to me got. The steak was a nice size and the frites came all wrapped in a little paper cone. The bartender was very nice, he was attentive but also made sure we were just left to sit and enjoy each other. If you want a taste of Paris in Ballard this is the place to go. I will definatly be back with the hubs for some steak and frites! The back bar is the place to be on a Friday/Saturday/RANDOM Monday night. &#160;Their food is delicious and if you catch them at happy hour, it's definitely a lot less expensive. &#160;Being a vegetarian, there aren't many things on the menu to eat, but you can easily get a delicious falafel wrap and some champignons which are out of this world (and loved by meat eaters as well). &#160;If you're not a vegetarian, go for the mussles, it's Moules Mondays for the month of March!The decor is warm and cozy and the service is supurb! I've never had to wait long for a drink, the servers are quick to respond to any request and fill up your water without even having to ask repeatedly for it. &#160;Overall, it's a great place for all of the following:1. A romantic dinner2. A family dinner3. Drinks with friends4. Last call drunken ridiculousness5. Happy Hour I haven't spent enough time in Ballard but I am really glad that I got to check out this restaurant. &#160;It had a very French feel and one of my buddies who spent time in France really got a kick out of all the subtleties of French style that surrounded us. &#160;I thought the atmosphere was clean and lively and we decided to sit around the fire near the bar since there was only 4 of us and it was freezing outside. &#160;Good choice.The restaurant is actually very large however the service is good and prompt. &#160;They were out of the duck that night but I imagine it happens sometimes. &#160;I ordered a steak and it came out tender with a ton of flavor so I was extremely happy with my food. &#160;My friends ordered a bit more French entrees and they all liked them quite a bit. &#160;They seem to get a lot of their vegetables locally and have a chalkboard near the entrance with their local options so that was great because they are paying attention to our world and getting quality ingredients... instead of most places just interested in the bottom line. &#160;You pay for it but the food is definitely worth it!I really enjoyed Bastille and will definitely go back to try some different things. &#160;Ballard is definitely a great area so places like this are making me want to spend much more time exploring what it has to offer. After my most recent visit to Bastille (a fourth without a review, my God!), I have two things to say. First, I'm grateful I had three other visits to balance this one out. Second, I'll need three more visits to balance this one out.I've been to Bastille for a lovely peanut butter dessert and French 75 in the summertime, basking in the warmth of the patio. I've been to Bastille for beautiful salads, easing my sadness at returning from Paris and leaving French food behind. I've been to Bastille for a fantastic lamb burger, washed down with expertly chosen glasses of red wine.But although I've read about moments where other food lovers have been confronted with a culinary disaster, I've never been anywhere and had my meal fall into that category. Except now I can say I've been to Bastille for my first (and hopefully only) time for that.Back bar, happy hour. Sexy spot, beautifully tempting and well-priced cocktails, and excellent service. No complaints as far as that goes: the problem arrived in the form of a sunchoke gratin. I've cooked sunchokes before, and in fact many a root vegetable in many a way, and one of the ways you know that your root vegetable is in fact a cooked one is by testing its give. And when you can barely force a knife through its fibers, it isn't done. And so that means you shouldn't pop it into a little broiling dish and cover it with a decent comte and cream gratin and send it out.And thank God I was only paying the $5 happy hour price for it, because if I'd had to pay the regular menu price of $13, those would have been the most begrudged dollars I've ever spent on food anywhere. (By the way, that includes the dollars spent on food in my Yelp review of Denny's: check it.)I know this kitchen is capable of good-to-great things, and I hope to be back to try some more of those offerings. But at the same time, this gratin was one of the worst-prepared dishes I've had in Seattle, and I'm surprised it made it out to the floor. Next time? Lamb burger, baby. And maybe a fourth star.... I'll admit upfront that I'm a little biased towards this place since I met my boyfriend here. haha. The first time I came here, it was for a birthday party. &#160;I had the petite soupe a l'oignon: gratin&#233;ed French onion soup with cave-aged Gruy&#232;re. &#160;It was good but I didn't think much of it afterward.We decided to come back for an anniversary for old times sake. &#160;My boyfriend made reservations about 2 weeks in advance. &#160;Andddd they promptly lost it. &#160;They tried to seat us by the fire pit but I wanted a proper table so we waited there with some bread. &#160;The table took a good 20 minutes (it was a Monday) and I'm pretty sure the waitress forgot about us. Once seated, we ordered a carafe of house white wine and I ordered the risotto and champignons sauvages: risotto with foraged mushrooms, mascarpone &amp; parmesan. &#160;My boyfriend ordered a duck and potato dish (can't remember the name as they have a few similar ones). &#160;Both were excellent (duck according to him). &#160;The risotto, mushrooms and cheese were seriously melt in your mouth, some of the best risotto I've had. &#160;The ambience is also nice and romantic. &#160;You've got your cute French decor, the candles, mood lighting. &#160;I would recommend this place for a date. I'm sure we'll be back. :) Just lovely. A very European air without the snobbery. And the food is delightful! We went for the prix fixe SRW meal (one of my favorite ways to see if hyped places are worth it), and Bastille exceeded expectations.I had a smoked salmon appetizer -- basically the rich man's lox &amp; bagles -- and the salmon was a perfect texture and flavor, the pea vines were a lovely afterthought, and the egg was done beautifully. The broth for the entree steamed clams was perfectly balanced and flavorful. I had two of the specially designed cocktails (La Bicyclette and the Darjeeling Express), and they both were inventive, interesting and amusing to the tongue. Also, the waiter's eagerness and enthusiasm to discuss the drinks with us was adorable (and the service throughout the meal excellent)! The only thing that was slightly disappointing was dessert. My mini-brioche-like biscut was a bit dry and hard, and the sauces that came with it a bit dull, however, the rum-soaked balls of apple hidden under the whipped cream were a comforting burried treasure.All and all, Bastille landed another couple of regulars via SRW, and I'm excited to see what else they've got! Love the interior and decor of this place. &#160;Great for dates.Came here on Wednesday night and the crowd was a little older; &#160;I guess that's usually the case for a moderately priced restaurant. extensive wine selection but i wasn't feeling fancy so opted for beer. We ordered baguette to start. &#160;I ordered the pan roasted chicken and my friend ordered the mussels and frites. The chicken was nicely plated. &#160;It was moist but the sauce was a tad bit salty. &#160;The mussels came piled high in a thin/light curry base (hinted with star anise?).Food is good would come again. Cool place. Good croque monsieur.I'm definitely planning to return. Best falafel I've ever had. Done just right and tasty. Also tasted the Mediterranean sea bass and that was excellent also. Went with a group of friends on a February Sunday evening and were seated out on the heated enclosed patio. Service started out good, then dropped off as the place filled.Prices are high relative to the portion size. $12 for a bibb lettuce head cut in half and a wedge of Gorgonzola blue cheese? But if you like this kind of thing, primarily meat-based french country cooking, that probably goes with the territory.Back bar looks like a good alternative for an evening out, and I think they serve food back there too. Old/new world ambiance and vibe. Cute, cute, cute! I love the space, very airy with a French bistro feel. They have a nice little terrace area which I imagine can be great during the summer and they also had a round fireplace bar which I thought was cool to eat around. I got the lavender brioche French toast which was good, I didn't really taste any hint of lavender though but it still wasn't bad. Service was great, no wait, and food came out fast. We also ordered bread with sea salt butter to help stave off hunger pains before our meal came out. I would have thought that though the bread/butter should be complimentary but oh wells. I would come back again but would try something new this time. Nearly everything was perfect last night on my first visit to Bastille Cafe &amp; Bar, a French restaurant in hip Ballard. &#160;A friend and I shared the palm hearts salad, the Steak Frites, and a French apple tart. &#160;I had a glass of Rhone wine to drink. The steak was cooked to perfection at medium-rare: &#160;it almost melted in your mouth with tenderness. &#160;The frites were probably the best I've had in Seattle. &#160;The palm hearts salad was the only item I wasn't 100% on - it wasn't as flavorful as I would have liked. &#160;But still, good.Even with sharing, I had plenty to eat. This would be 5-stars except for how loud the restaurant is. &#160;That is very un-French :)Smooth Fiore decaf espresso to finish. I'll be back. I ate a wonderful dinner at Bastille yesterday with my lovely lady and I was extremely impressed. The first thing that stood out to me was the beautiful layout and decor of the restaurant. Fashioned after a French Subway Station, Bastille really brings a ton of personality with it's warm decor.The food was astounding. We had an assortment of the specials, which included a delicious Foies de Volaille- Chicken Liver Pate, Clams in a Parsley Garlic Sauce, Beef Short Ribs and Brussel Sprouts in a Cheese Sauce, White Truffel Linguine, AMAZING Frog Legs, Pork Belly with Pickled Apples and Onion, and a delicious assortment of the desserts.The food was expertly prepared and full of flavor. Each bite was a party in my mouth. The desserts were by far the highlight of the dining experience for me. I had an amazing Crepe Cake accompanied by some insanely delicious homemade ice cream. Definitely try a few different dessert items, because they each have something completely different to offer.The service was wonderful. We attended dinner on a Monday, so it was not very busy. Our server was very attentive and educated when it came to the food served.Overall, I really enjoyed my dining experience at Bastille. I will definitely be coming back in the near future to see what other amazing dishes they have to offer. Let's talk about Bastille. First, I have been here in the past, liked it, but never felt compelled to say much of anything about it. A few weeks ago I came again for dinner and had a fairly memorable experience, so now it is worth discussing. General matters of note include: (1) sit in the back bar area if you can at least once because it is a cool space; (2) great ambiance. Kind of makes me feel like going to (read: long for) Balthazar in NYC. Best part about this place is the feeling that maybe you are somewhere else..like the Village, Soho or Paris; (3) everything on the menu is solid...the Steak Frites in particular has terrific flavor; (4) they serve Caffe Fiore. Hands down the best coffee in Seattle, in my humble opinion. Big plus for that. (5) dessert is nothing special...feel free to skip it in favor of the current Seattle crazes which include cupcakes, ice cream or custard. Highlight of the evening: We felt like a bottle of white, but to go with steak frites? What would it be? The server didn't have a clue, so she did the appropriate thing and sent over their sommelier. He was fantastic and pointed us in the direction of a white Bordeaux. I thoroughly enjoyed it. I think it actually made the night for me. Biggest complaint: Inconsistent service. We started out with a bang, but it quickly fell off. When I have been here in the past I have never had service that was very special. That should improve to move Bastille among Seattle nighborhood dining elite. Bottom line: Well worth a try - and worthy of a repeat visit for dinner, or brunch, or drinks... Something changed for me on the night I recently dined at Bastille. Perhaps the influence of feeling like I was somewhere else did away with any politically correct Seattleite inhibitions I have left over. Or maybe I was just happy to be in Ballard again? Either way, I'm not saying it was 100% the restaurant, or that you will have a shift in perspective after eating here... But listen, it's not every day you savor a white Bordeaux on a rainy night! I will gladly fight for a space in the back bar for late night happy hour and order the lamb burger, falafel, another lamb burger. &#160;Great deals on HH cocktails too. Beautiful restaurant. When you walk in it pretty much speaks for itself. A great back bar hidden away at the back of the restaurant. Amazing decor and fabulous food to boot. Friendly staff and it's owned by two fun and down to earth men. This is a great first date place to take your girl. Very romantic and hip all at the same time. Definitely check it out. But call ahead first because the place packs out quick. Food is awesome, always awesome. Our servers are always good. One dark haired individial likes to always correct my pronunciation of French when we go, lame, but I dont go for the server, but the food, of course! &#160;Music is fantastic and food, again, is incredible. A favorite spot in Seattle - love cozy bar tucked away in the backroom, smitten upon sight. Laidback dim-lit gastropub, interesting craft cocktails.. pates and tempting small plates perfect to snack on. Great date spot or small parties. Pleasant staff, good music. Very enjoyable. &#160;The atmosphere, location, service, drinks and cuisine are classic French cuisine! A perfect unpretentious beautiful and sexy French bistro that serves classic French dishes. The service is excellent and the food is very tasty! I will definitely come back to Bastille again and again and.. Again :) Food was good, nothing supper special, really just a French bisto. Wait staff was great. So, here's the real problem. The Noise level was almost enough to make us leave, when we walked in. They made the place really nice, and then left a concrete floor, lots of glass and it makes your ears hurt. Even the waiter said, don't come on Friday, you will need a hearing aid. Oh well. Bastille is a wonderful place to grab breakfast/brunch/lunch while perusing the Ballard Market, and that's usually what I do. The place is huge so there's rarely a wait that I've seen, and the food is really fresh, whole, just.. good. Love that they source their herbs and some produce from their rooftop garden. This place does omelettes as omelettes are meant to be done... smooth, buttery, light yellow creamy goodness studded with some of those aforementioned fresh herbs. Perfect next to their crispy smashed potatoes and a cup of coffee with fresh cream. It will make you happy. Tried the lamburger and the frites. Ho friggity hum. I mean it was fine but a little greasy and on the salty side. I was there for Sunday Branch. I must say their atmosphere is excellent and service is okay. However, if you are someone who watch your weight (starch or carb) or who has some food allergy, don't go. They do not substitute anything. I was extremely disappointed the high end place like this does not willing to go extra miles to meet customer's special needs. Again, this is not the place for someone who wants balanced diet and working hard to stay thin. &#160;I also disappointed that they do not serve their coffee in a french press style. I may go back there just to enjoy the atmosphere and ignore about foods and services. Ate the pork cheeks, great. Really, really great. Bartender was fing snooty, like "I'm the only person in the world that ever learned anything about wine" snooty. Should be noted that I had this experience in July 2010. Beautiful place! Beautiful! Save the snootiness, no one gets off on it. Superb food and drinks, good service, great atmosphere. Frites are second to none, and the food I have had there is good. Only caveat is the price. Excellent french toast. &#160;Bastille takes reservations for brunch. Great happy hour drinks; try the Bees Nees or French 75. The frites are the best thing on the HH menu, all else is a little over priced. The burger is okay, but I wouldn't order again. The HH food isn't very impressive, but I'm usually content with fries and a drink.Dinner there is wonderful. Ordered the steak, and it was perfection. A friend had the salmon and loved it too. Go to Bastille for the interior design if anything, it's a beautiful restaurant. I came here for brunch on a Sunday. &#160;The place was busy as to be expected with the Ballard Famers Market going on in full force out front. &#160;I've always wanted to come here for brunch. &#160;We sat at the fireplace off the bar which was very nice. Considering how busy they are the service was good and the food didn't take to long. &#160;Two of us had the duck confit hash. &#160;I've never seen fewer potatoes served with a has and since when should duck confit be in a broth? &#160;The dish wasn't bad at all but it was on the smaller side ( espeically with the lack of potatoes) and it needed something to get all the broth so we ordered a side of bread ( perhaps it should have come with toast???). My friends lavendar french toast was very good. &#160;I've come here before for happy hour and had the falafel which was pretty good but my brunch left me somewhat unimpressed. &#160;Unless I am at the Sunday Farmers Market I doubt I'll go back again other than for Happy Hour. I came here on a very nice and sunny morning. Was seated instantly for four people. We asked for a baguette but the waitress forgot it... however, when we mentioned it she offered it to us for free. I ordered the lavender hazelnut french toast. I just could not believe how great it was. It was perfectly cooked. For all of you newbie's to Seattle like I am, finding a new "hole in the wall" is what life is all about, isn't it? When i was invited out on a first date to Bastille (the back bar - I still haven't been up front), I honestly had never heard of it. Wow, was i pleasantly surprised. First of all, the place is really beautiful inside with what i can only describe as authentic french style artwork and interior layout. It seems as though they have spared no expense in any aspect of recreating a uniquely french and NW hybrid of design. The food was superb, I had the croque off the happy hour menu and couldnt have been happier. The only negative point that I would say was that the layout was a little cluttered and getting from our seats to the bathroom or to the bar was congested. I feel like they could have taken out some of the extra seating to make the customers feel like it was more intimate. I wish i could have given them a 4.5 star but this site doesnt allow that.... Besides that though, the bartenders really knew their drinks and were very helpful with the menu. I will come back for sure for the front restaurant for a full dinner! A great place to meet up with friends for happy hour. The atmosphere is especially warm on a colder, rainy day. Their bread is super yummy. The sunchoke gratin was perfect. The cocktails are divine. If you are patient and like a more adult environment. This is a great place for a romantic dinner or night cap. The service is good and the wait staff knowledgeable about the menu. i must have become a "yelper" after i'd dined here a few times, as i'm surprised i haven't already reviewed bastille. anyhow, went in on a friday night for dinner a few weeks ago and enjoyed:GRAND CENTRAL BAGUETTEWith Plugr&#225; butter &amp; sea salt**yumSALADE VERTE.Mixed greens in champagne vinaigrette with crushed hazelnuts**and they grow their own lettuce (during growing season) on their roof! how cool is that? otherwise it's local lettuce/produce. i thought $9 was a little steep for a green salad, but such as it is.POISSON DU JOUR**there were 2 fish of day specials this dining evening and my companion and ordered 1 of each to share. 1 was the wild king salmon with baby bok choy and something else that embarrassingly escapes me now but was good; and the other was halibut with a mushroom ragu so rich and flavorful a whole entree could have been made from that alone! and spinach.GRATIN DE CARDONChard gratin with fennel cream &amp; comt&#233; cheese**scrumptious. can't really go wrong with dark hearty greens and cheese, now can you?SALTED PEANUT BUTTER CR&#200;ME GLAC&#201;E Cocoa nib feuilletine &amp; Jivara cr&#232;meux**i've ordered this 3 times now because i'm so in love with that. perhaps it's time i branch out to other desserts on the menu which i'm sure are also delectable, but this is just sublime. my date didn't feel like dessert so i was forced (!) to eat this all on my own (the hardship!). creamy peanut butter ice cream, with only a light salted flavor, not over the top, and these decadent granola-like clusters of thin crispy crunchy flakes. incredible.i really like the energy of this place - always bustling with lots of people. we sat in the heated enclosed patio which was almost too warm but so nice on a cold night. i was under-impressed with our server who seemed bored and didn't offer much to the dining experience. Bastille has been around for a solid year now. &#160;Happy hour menu is great. &#160;Try the monk's habit and if you like lamb and you like burgers, by all means you have to try to lamb burger. &#160;The other plus to the place is the atmosphere. &#160;They have a little known back bar that is awesome. &#160;The attention to every detail with the bar, the interior design, circle fireplace near the window, the tiled columns etc... I usually don't notice those types of things that much in a restaurant, but you cant help notice the amazing atmosphere and beautiful details in the place. &#160;Makes me feel like I am at an older restaurant in Paris or Italy. The decor is pretty cool. This is definitely one of the trendy places to go in Ballard. &#160; I think that the happy hour is probably where you get the best experience, but I haven't had the opportunity to do this yet. Went on a date night (Saturday). Without reservations, the bar was the only option without a wait. &#160;I ordered a tomato salad, which was rather bland and nothing special and the pork confit sandwich. &#160;The sandwich was RICH. After asking the server about how it was prepared, I thought it would melt in my mouth, but I found it to be too rich and it was just missing something-maybe just more of the mustard sauce. &#160;My hubby ordered the lamb burger, which is definitely a winner ( I don't even like lamb all that much). It was really good and had an awesome sauce. The frites, as expected, were pretty good too. &#160;Overall, the place is a bit spendy (probably to pay for the truly awesome decor) and didn't quite deliver, but I will try again. I really wanted to like this place; it's just a lovely space and has so much potential. We've tried it 5 or 6 times now and our experience never gets any better. Specifically the reception from the staff; warmth is not their forte. We eat out a lot and one of our favorite haunts in Cafe Press, the French Cafe in Capital Hill. We were just there yesterday and our experience was miles and miles better than our experience at Bastille today. It's like Bastille hires their staff from outer space or something. For instance today, I asked our waitress if she'd ever tried the lamb burger with feta and she gave me this long, puzzled expression (head cocked to the side) and it took about 15 seconds to answer; I thought that the question was either off-putting or she'd had a small seizure. It was really weird; we asked each other later what that was all about. It was like I'd asked her to recite Pi. The service is inattentive and she never came back to check on us during our meal. They were out of the lamb burger as it turns out (this has happened to us often - they run out of things) so I ordered one of their omelets. Not only was it bland but they got my order wrong. It's just eggs - come on people. Omelets at High Spot and Portage Bay put Bastille's to shame. Comparing French Cafes, in comparison Cafe Press' overall experience including their omelets, frites and croque monsieur are much better than Bastille's. I would give it 1 star if it were not for the decor, location, espresso and the lamb burger (sans the disappointing frites). I decided today this was the last time I'd give Bastill a try; I'll just high tail it over to Cafe Press or Le Pichet where the food and service put Bastille to shame. i love this place for breakfast/bunch, finally had dinner there the other night. got the MAGRET DE CANARD (duck breast) it was alright, i don't think i will go their for dinner again. for french dinners there are much better places in seattle
I had gone by this place as they were moving in and preparing to open for business. &#160;I was very eager to come in and try a crepe.The interior design is a little disconcertingly orange. &#160;The attempted in vain to make bulges of walls less noticeable with some sort of ugly rubber sheet affair that probably only serves to make people imagine the walls are in worse condition than they really are. &#160;I have been in this retail space during several previous incarnations and this one is, in appearance, the worst. &#160;They should at least let people cover those walls with posters; my friend suggested travel posters.I had the Caramel Apple Crepe. &#160;I have to warn that I'm not a big crepe guy; I don't have a long and varied history of crepe consumption to compare my experience to. &#160;I thought it was pretty good. &#160;It's not something I think I would get half as often Ave staples like teriyaki (Nasai) or Thai (Tom's) or Chinese (China First).Crepes are like light, thin pancakes. &#160;According to Wikipedia they are usually made of wheat flour and even though they originate from northwest France they are popular throughout the whole French world in contemporary times.Our crepe came as a multilayered dish. &#160;At the bottom was a crepe covered here and there with what I think was apple sauce. &#160;Over that was a second crepe that had strings that formed diamond-shaped lacing. &#160;Over this were patches of caramel sauce. &#160;In the center of all this was a patch of whipped cream with caramel sauce drizzle.The crepes per se pretty much match my one memory of previously having crepes from about thirty years ago. &#160;I can't remember how I had those crepes so long ago. &#160;This time, though, the particularly savory bites were those from areas where caramel and apple collided in optimal ratios and amounts. &#160;I would have liked just a little more caramel and apple distributed a little more evenly.I found the staff to be nice enough. &#160;They are very smart to stay open until 3 a.m. Friday and Saturday nights. &#160;Along with Memo's, they are helping bring about the 24 hour Ave. &#160;They definitely need something to indicate that they are open after 9 p.m., because when we came by at 8:45 p.m. we were at first unsure whether they were open or not.It remains to be seen in crepes are another Ave gimmick food that will come and go or if they have any staying power. &#160;They are definitely competitive in price with a lot of the aforementioned Ave staples.Three stars is average, and average isn't bad. &#160;It's worth it to learn a friendly Russian greeting and go try a crepe or two. I had high hopes for this place but was a little let down. The interior is lacking and the only ambience was the 106.1 radio station blasting from the kitchen. But on to the food. I had the lunch special, which consists of one savory crepe, some slaw, and a bowl of soup. The soup was loaded with dill - not my favorite. It was passable. The slaw was light and paired well with my lamb crepe. The lamb was delicious and the crepe was good too. I guess I was just expecting more. I left feeling like I needed more food in my stomach than one crepe. Next time I'll just go with the two crepes and ditch the lunch special. The service when ordering is painfully slow, but maybe they were just understaffed that day? One guy was taking the orders, manning the register, and bringing the food out, and he was in no hurry at all. I would've ordered a dessert crepe but had to forgo it as a group of five that came in took over 15 minutes to order and pay for their food...and I had to get back to work. I will likely return someday to try their sweet crepes. Nutella is calling my name! Love this place! Crepes are fantastic, they serve both sweet and savory (and some vegetarian). Prices are super affordable. Hours are fabulous and the owners are so nice and superb. Definitely a destination place in the University District! (Also my suggestion would be the nuttella crepe with bananas, just saying it the best) I live right across the street and I find myself craving a lot of crepes recently!!! Crepe Craters has a pretty wide selection of meal crepes and dessert crepes. I wouldn't consider myself a crepe expert but I know that this place makes some greeeaaaat food. The ingredients are fresh, the flavors are unique, and the crepes just melt in your mouth. Definitely worth a try if you are in the u-district. You kind of have to hunt this place down. But, they serve up a pretty delicious varietal crepe. Everything from meat to fruit. I think crepes are really just skinny little pancakes, but crepe sounds so fancilicious. The surrounding aren't all so great, but put your head down and eat the crepe in front of you. I haven't had a such delicious meal in a long time. It is finger liking good and tastes like home cooked food all natural ingredients and I could not believe that for dessert menu they use real lemons. They have all kinds of crepes and my favorite are the ones with meat! Now I will always crave one!Audrey
Any chance I get to eat with my hands and have it be socially acceptable, I'm down. &#160;Regardless, I still managed to eat like a total slob, spilling meat and mashed lentils(at least that's what I think they were) all over myself and the table in the general vicinity of my mouth, but you'll hear no apologies from this guy. &#160;I had a smile on my face all the while.I loved every bite. &#160;I actually found myself day dreaming about it today, wishing I had just one more bite of that delicious Talapia seasoned to perfection. &#160;Also, I love places where the food is served on one platter for you and your dinner companion to share. &#160; It makes me feel like we both had an equal hand in eating the food before us, even though we both know I had more than my fair share of the food. &#160;Oh well, out of sight, out of mind.That being said, I love this place, and it won't be too soon that I am back stuffing my crepe with small piles of undetermined mashed substances. YUM!I live in the CD, home to many walkable Ethiopian eateries...Why go to Cap Hill? &#160;Well, this one is way up there in taste, service, and portions. &#160;The veg platter here is good; I recommend extra greens ($2) so you don't have to fight over them.Man...this cuisine can be so unkind later in the night that I am not sure I'd make it a date destination. &#160;Your mileage may vary, and it *is* worth it. Once, I was a sheltered young suburbanite whose idea of "ethnic food" was Americanized Chinese food. My first exposure to the idea of an Ethiopian restaurant was someone telling me an extremely worn out joke that isn't funny enough to repeat, and then a serious endorsement and a basic explanation of injera, the traditional spongy bread that is used in the place of utensils. Many years later, after moving to the Seattle area, I noticed Queen Sheba across the street while going to Vivace with a friend and decided to try it out.Despite having about five different dining companions here over many dinner visits, what inevitably seems to happen is sharing the vegetarian sampler of five different dishes including tasty lentils and greens as well as the yebeg wat, a lamb dish in a reddish-brown sauce that is spicy to my taste but still edible for my companions.Another less food-related reason I find myself coming back here is that Queen Sheba works well as part of an affordable dinner date before catching a show or other main event on Capitol Hill. It's not ideal for a first date as concern with first impressions doesn't mix well with the inevitable mess of eating with injera, but it's good for a relaxed second or third date (and at least I would personally be wary of someone who, under no pressure, is too uptight to forego utensils.)My only negatives about this place are:- It gets a bit hot inside during the summer.- At peak dinner times on weekends there can be a bit of a wait (I've waited about 20 minutes for a table for 2 on more than one occasion on a Saturday night.)- Parking is the standard Capitol Hill street parking.My only usual regret after dinner at Queen Sheba is that I'm so full of good food that there's no way I can go to Dilettante afterward in the same evening for dessert. Try it, you are unlikely to be disappointed. Love, love, love, love, LOVE this place! &#160;A friend recommended it to my bf and I, and we've been hooked ever since! &#160;Great atmosphere and VERY kind servers. &#160;Plus, the iced chai tea is a huge glass and delicious! &#160;Great ethiopian food (the spices are perfectly used in the dishes) and if you enjoy middle eastern food and aren't afraid to eat with your hands, then you should give it a try! &#160; *****! I loved Queen Sheba - had the veggie and meat combo, which was more than enough for me and 2 friends. Try their honey wine - it's sweet enough to stand on its own as a dessert. YUM! &#160;Service was great, and there was absolutely no wait when I went - this place is a gem. Had dinner last night and one of the best food I ever had.Tried their spicy chicken and Lamb tibs and just couldnt stop myself from foxing it. There is something very earthy about eating with your hands but a great experience nevertheless. Not very pricey. They have 3 Ethiopian beers as well as one non-alcoholic too. &#160;Not bad either.Might go again this week. OK, four stars, but I wanted to do four and a half. Where's the half stars, yelp? Anyway, good Ethiopian food. Great Ethiopian food. After having tried three others (four if you count Pan-African by Pike Place), I decided my review could be made, fairly and justly. The veggie platter is great, all the flavors are distinct, spiced well, and some are even kind of spicy, which I love. The other places I've been at, all residing down in the CD, haven't had the hotness that Sheba achieves. Each person gets their own basket of injera, so you are not reaching over your neighbor to get more. The platter is also perfectly sized. I come out beautifully full, with a nicely rounded belly. The honey wine was great, and though Sheba doesn't have the best wine prices (Mesob does) they are not the most expensive. Beyond that, the service is decent, not the best, but decent and warm, the crowd is mostly good, excepting certain groups that have a certain hostile, douchebag vibe, and the atmosphere was comfortable. Go here! Drink some wine, share some food, have fun again! Queen Sheba is a safe bet for Ethiopian food. The injera is cooked well, and is so so delicious. I always get the veggie combo platter, which comes with a variety of yummy vegan options....and they are all great, particularly their shiro wot. They are seasoned well, with a few that are spicier, for those who like the heat. The Ethiopian Honey Wine (Mild is better than sweet) compliments the meal well. It is not overly sweet and syrupy...but simply delicious! It is light, with a hint of sweetness, and tastes like honey, without overdoing it. It reminds me &#160;of what nectar from a flower might taste like....and of spring time. Of course this is a place you'll want to go with close friends/date since you'll be sharing a big platter (as with any Ethiopian establishment). There is this great sense of sharing and intimacy that is created when eating good Ethiopian food. Eating with your hands and w/out silverware is also a fun change and works out great. Prices were very reasonable. After all of this praise, I feel it necessary to comment on the service. Just feel that they could be a bit more friendly and often very slow. On busier nights, they are definitely under staffed. But that's really a side note. On the whole, it was a very good experience. Go there, eat and make merry...you won't be disappointed! My 2nd Ethiopian excursion.So between here and Kokeb, the differences lie in the Injera. &#160;They only serve the grey sourdough type here whereas Kokeb served both the sourdough and the wonderbread type. &#160;Also I felt that the spices here were more pronounced than at Kokeb.I've yet to taste the "fire" that I keep hearing about with Ethiopian food, but the chicken pieces?? &#160;I'm not even sure what it was in the red sauce was awesome. &#160;If it was spicier I would have only ordered that. &#160;The lamb or beef or whatever it was seemed a bit on the bland side. &#160;The dish with the chicken leg and the hard boiled egg felt bland as well.That said, I'm a fan of Ethiopian food and the fare here was just as good in it's own way as the other place I tried. &#160;I left oh so full and had the "breath" for the rest of the night. &#160;haha. &#160;You know what I'm talking about ...Parking kind of sucked and the people that kept opening the door and not shutting it kind of got on my nerves (cold and windy day) but overall I had a good meal and thought the food was great. Good food, good prices, friendly service. Recommend the vegetarian combo. Mmmmmm . . . Queen Sheba is very yummy.Order a bunch of dishes; they will all come out on a plate together and then you can all just attack them with your hands. &#160;It's messy. &#160;And you'd better be close friends! &#160;But the food is delicious and quite fairly priced.They've got a really tasty selection of juices like Guava, Mango, and Banana which are very refreshing and go great with the food.If there's a complaint about Queen Sheba, it's that there are VERY few employees. &#160;Service tends to be really slow, so I don't recommend this place if you are in a rush. &#160;It can also get really busy on Saturday nights; I recommend trying to go ata &#160;time when it's less busy; you'll get better service and a better seat! Finally, I don't get looked down on when I am stuffing my face without using utensils! &#160;This food was very good. &#160;It was fresh and we had plenty of it. &#160;Service was so/so considering we were one of only 2 groups eating there. &#160;I was often left staring at an empty water glass with my mouth on fiyah! &#160;They would have gotten 4 stars if we had a better waitress. &#160;It's true rating from me would probably be 3.5 stars. I really enjoy this restaurant. &#160;Your food is served on one platter for the table so you can try each other's food if you wish. &#160;I have never had a dish I didn't like, nor have I ever left hungry. &#160;You can order dinner &amp; a beer for less than $20. &#160;My only complaint is that it's often packed after work and the service is a little slow but the food makes it worth it. If you've got a big appetite and want tasty tasty food to fill you up, check out Queen Sheba.Get the Veggie Roll appetizer. &#160;It is the veggie plate rolled into injira, &#160;and cut into bite size pieces. &#160; If you have a big crowd, get more than one plate, because they go fast. &#160;I'm amazed how much I like these even with their lack of meaty substance.The samplers are good, and have a variety of food to pick from. &#160;I don't know the difference between a wot and a tib, but everything in the sampler is tasty stuff, even the boiled egg covered in brown sauce. &#160; If you go during the day, make sure you have enough time for a nap after you go. It is good to have an African restaurant right off Broadway but this is far from the best East African food you can find in Seattle. &#160;Too bland for my taste. &#160;Nice atmosphere, but if you want great full flavored food, look elsewhere. If you are into checking new tastes from the world this place wont let you down. Its good. Its exciting and its cool. Try the Ethiopian beer or wine. The vege combo platter is so good. Go try it .Go! Okay, so this is the only Ethiopian place I've eaten at ever. So take that as you may.I love the food here. Everything is good, especially if it has tibs in the name. Get a house tea while you're at it.The food gets 4 stars, but the service is slooooooow. Friendly, but slooooow.
My favorite Thai restaurant in the U-District.Located a little off the Ave., Little Thai has awesome Thai food for a little cheaper than the rest of the U-District Thai places. &#160;The restaurant is set set below the street so it's quieter than most of the Ave. restaurants.Seating is open and plentiful (great for large groups) and the wait staff is very friendly and as I said earlier, the food is first-class. &#160;It tastes cleaner and healthier than most Thai places. &#160;Give Little Thai a shot!A+ I'm not sure why places just off the Ave tend to have slightly better than Ave-standard food. Perhaps because they can't rely on the flow of hungry college students to keep them in business, and actually have to earn some word-of-mouth recommendations. In any case, this place is slightly better than AppeThaigerRoom65.My most recent order was the spicy rice noodles with chicken. The vegetables were crisp and flavorful; the chicken actually tasted like chicken; the little leafy bits that might have been basil were little, leafy and possibly basilish. Add to that a large, varied menu and the fastest Thai kitchen on the Ave, and this place earns a respectable 4.125 stars.It loses 0.125 stars because the stairwell is mysteriously full of flies. Realized that other than their phad thai, nothing else really impressed me. Actually one time, i ordered something and it was SO BLAND i just decided to order a phad thai.i'll just be going to thaiger room. When I first started coming here, the food seemed pretty good. However, as time has progressed, their food has gotten more bland and less exciting. There is great customer service but I will have to eliminate 2 stars for boring food. Oh, and be careful if you're not a big pepper eater. If you tell the lady you want SPICY, like spicy-spicy, she'll make your ass burn. There is one thing I order here. &#160;It's the combo, medium spicy, which includes, Thai Curry Chicken, rice, and Tofu Phad Thai. &#160;At $7.50, it's an excellent value compared to other Thai restaurants such as Thai 65 or Appe Thai on the Ave. &#160;Sometimes the Phad Thai is on the colder side since they probably pre-prepare large quantities of it during the peak of the lunch hour, but if you go when it's less busy, you'll get a fresh batch.If you haven't been here, it's hidden in the basement of the light blue building just next to the Starbucks on 42nd, right off of the Ave.They add $.50 to Credit/Debit purchases, which is a bummer. We stopped in at Little Thai for lunch. &#160;It was nearby, and offered downstairs dining which made things a little quieter compared to the other Thai places directly on The Ave. &#160;As another reviewer mentioned, they'll give you two menus - they're roughly the same, though one has pictures on it. &#160;Good if you're new to the whole Thai cuisine thing. &#160;The variety is impressive, and you might feel a little intimidated about the more obscure dishes. &#160;Pad Thai is a safe bet here, though I opted for the Lunch Combo. &#160;The combination included a curry, a noddle dish, rice, and a spring roll with a little sweet sauce for $7.50 at the time of this writing. &#160;Though my Dad's Pad Thai was served hot, my curry and noodle dish were somewhat cold. &#160;I suspect they pre-prepare some of their more popular items before hand, so it might be a good idea to order a more obscure and adventuresome dish.The food was very good, and came in well sized portions. &#160;We definitely had left overs to bring home. &#160;The Thai Iced Tea is good, but tastes slightly less flavorful than other Thai places. &#160;The service was very friendly and cordial, always smiling. &#160;If you need to use the restroom ask for the key, which is attached to a massive ring, further weighted by a large piece of split bamboo. &#160;I think the idea is that you couldn't lose the thing if you tried. &#160;Chuck it into the Pacific and it'll float on the waves and find its way home. &#160;Then again, you're only walking down the hallway to the bathroom.By its subterranean nature, this is very much a "hole in the wall" and exactly the kind of cheap eating I like in the university environment. &#160;It's an out-of-the-way and cozy place with good food. &#160;The fish tank is pretty awesome too. This place had the fastest service for a Thai restaurant I've ever experienced. &#160;Our food came about 5 minutes after we sat down and ordered. &#160;The panang curry with vegetables was awesome. &#160;It had just the right amount of spiciness with a ton of rich panang curry flavor....yum! &#160;Their Thai iced tea was also good. &#160;Not too sweet but it had a little too much ice in it. &#160;The food is a little more expensive though. &#160;I ordered the larb gai here to-go once and it costs around $7 for it....considering it that it was a salad appetizer. &#160;Nonetheless it was still pretty good so I can't complain. &#160;Compared to most of the other Thai places on the Ave, this place is different where it gives you that homey feeling where they don't try to rush you. &#160;The service was excellent too. &#160;Definitely try this place out if you're tired of eating at the other Thai restaurants on the Ave. Food is ok- kinda bland and slightly greasy. &#160;Everything else about the restaurant is great- food comes out fast, reasonably priced, nice atmosphere... but all in all, not my number one choice for thai food. This place was quite interesting. Walked in and the place smelt like rotting fish, but one of my friends said that the food was some of the best they had ever tried - so I had to stick through it. We ordered chicken satay to start, and the meal came out on "grandmas china" which made me laugh, but the appetizer was pretty good. Unfortunately I can't say the same about the entree. I ordered panang curry and was disappointed by the overly watery curry like plate that was put in front of me. They only offered white rice, and the portion was quite small for the price of the meal. Don't expect to see me back here, unless I get drug their again. pretty bland and on the greasy side. &#160;Many other Thai places close to it that kick it's ass. &#160;This would be great in say Alabama. Have been there a bunch of times and love this place. &#160;I like the swimming rama with chicken 4 stars and I always ask for the wide noodles because they make a wicked good wide noodle. &#160;The BF likes the chicken noodle soup that I think is only listed on the specials board among other things as well. &#160;A MUST is the chicken satay the chciken is soooooo tender and the peanut sauce is wonderful. &#160;The price is right, the place is cozy and the staff is wonderful in everyway I can say. &#160;Most important they serve beer and wine. The owner lady is delightfully friendly and the service is astoundingly fast--today, my take-out lunch was ready in under five minutes! This family-run business is a true gem in a neighborhood overfilled with mediocre Thai restaurants. I loved going when I lived down the street from this place. &#160;It took me two years at UW to finally want to try and stop by this place. &#160;I love going here because it's quiet and also serves good Thai food. &#160;The staff is very friendly and I stopping by here for a quick lunch to-go. &#160;This place is usually pretty easy to get a table since they have a good amount of space in the restaurant. &#160;It can get pretty busy during the lunch hour, but that's really it. &#160;The Phad Thai is pretty good (not the BEST), but tasty enough that I'll come by for some.Stop by for a nice quiet meal when you don't want to bother will crowds of long waits! This is what I think is one of the best Thai restaurants in the U district, at least compared to Thai 65, Thaiger Room, Veggie Veggie, Appethai, and Thai Spice. &#160;We go there a lot, and enjoy the food every time! &#160;I've had better Thai but not around here. I'm conflicted about this place because sometimes it's good, and other times, not so much. I usually stick with the phad thai (sometimes dry and sometimes saucy) but totally deviated and ordered some egg rolls the other day. Bad move. They were large, but weirdly hard and semi-crispy. On the plus side, everyone that works there is friendly. I judge new Thai restaurants by their spicy green papaya salads.Damn, there's is spicy. Low-key place, reasonable prices.
I'm pretty sure someone who was born and raised in Washington state wouldn't know good BBQ if it slapped them in the face. However, Pig Iron was pretty good. I started with a plate of friend green tomatos, which are honestly the best thing on the menu. If you go, definitely order up 2-3 servings of those!The entrees were OK. I appreciate that they BBQ their meats with sauce and spices and don't leave them bare. For some reason this is a trend up here. A horrible, sacrilegious trend. The brisket I had was very tender and their sauce selection was OK - not award winning.The issue I had with the menu was that when I think of BBQ I think of a big pile of food - different meats all on one plate. Maybe it was just the lunch menu, but I didn't see options to combine anything. I love great barba ma quue! As Homer would say, so I tried the pig iron. First off the service was a little slow (only one person serving, and it was a Saturday,) but no big problem. Had the brisket plate with the corn bread dressing and the smoked beans. The brisket was awesome great smoke ring and flavor was spot on. The cornbread dressing was really interesting tasted like and very moist tamale, had a really good jalapeno taste. The smoked beans were not what you expect, taste more like a chili than a baked bean, unexpected but great. The carolina mustard sauce is right there and there regular sauce fits perfect with the brisket. I would say that it is a little overpriced and that would be the reason for 4 stars. Great stuff! Went here last week with my friends and her fam for a goodbye dinner. They've come here a lot apparently and it's an old favorite. I had the pulled pork sandwich and was very happy--I do wish I tried some of their sauces more to test them out (they offered a sweeter one and a spicier chipotle one I believe). The other folks I was with had the fried green tomato sandwich, the brisket plate, and the ribs. I was extremely satisfied, though my main complaint was that they wouldn't allow any substitutions with sides. Why I couldn't get sweet potato fries (aka my guilty pleasure) as my side to a sandwich unless I ordered the much more expensive plate? Seemed silly to restrict the sandwich eaters to either cole slaw or potato salad. Cole slaw was pretty decent though. A bit too out of the way for me normally, but I would definitely eat there again if I was in the neighborhood (let's face it, probably infrequent, but shhh)They did have some nice mixed drinks, served in preserve jars. Helped add to the ambience, but don't know how good the margaritas actually were. I really enjoyed my food here, unlike what others have said. I ordered a 1/4 breast of smoked chicken, with BBQ sauce off (you can put your own on). It was great white meat, so tender, and a hefty portion of protein. I was impressed! Good flavor! With it I ordered some lower carb sides, so opted for the collard greens and the spinach casserole. I was pleased and impressed by both sides! Good sized portions, and the spinach casserole was cheesy goodness. I seriously want that recipe!! The slice of bread that came with the meal was not needed, as wasn't even toasted. My husband ordered the BBQ pork, which he enjoyed. His cream of corn and cole slaw were also good. The salad we ordered with dinner was a bit pricey, but was tasty. Too bad they only have 1 salad dressing there, but it was quite good. Good, quick service, as the place had few people there.Come on folks...go get some good BBQ at Pig Iron- I highly recommend a plate, not sandwich, as you'll get lots of meat, and good sized sides. Nice selection of beers, too. Pig Iron BBQ Rocks! &#160;If you just want good food, this place is it. &#160;The brisket is the best in town and many of the sides mouth watering. &#160;Food is defintely 5+ stars, service is a bit spotty and is 2 or 3. &#160;The alcoholic beverages are watered down and expensive, so don't bother. I've only been there once, had the pulled pork sandwich. &#160;Like someone else said, I'm kind of surprised now by all the great reviews.The meat was dry (yes, I put extra sauce on it, but shouldn't it already have had some flavor?). The sauce I tried was bland (I think it was their regular). &#160;And, when I opened my take out box, there was a huge piece of pork skin/fat in my sandwich. &#160;I am pretty sure the guy slopping it on the lame-ass bun would have seen it if he took 2 seconds to look. &#160;So for $10, I definitely wouldn't go back which is sad because I really wanted to like it and I really like BBQ. The Pig Iron is our choice for BBQ in Seattle. They have Shiner Bock on tap, cherry limeade, and some of the best brisket I've ever had. I love their Puyallup Fair sauce.As a rule, their sides are excellent and bring a lot of flavor and verve to the BBQ of one's choice.The downside is slow service. However, it's worth it more often than not. A friend actually recommended Slim's Last Chance Saloon next door for the chili, but Slim's is a "21 and over" joint, and I was with my younger daughter so we decided on Pig Iron instead. Well, that and when I checked out Yelp! I saw my three favorite words...."Shiner on tap". Pig Iron had promise. It even had an unpaved parking lot. :) But would the food live up to the promise? My daughter and I both had the beef brisket sandwich, her's with beans, and mine with cole slaw, an order of sweet potato fries, iced tea, and of course Shiner on tap. OK....I was born in MS, grew up in New Orleans, and lived in TX for 10 years, so I've had some really good BBQ over the years. The Meat: I'm a fan of dry rubs, smoked meat, and a spicy sauce on the side. The brisket at Pig Iron was good.....but not great. There was a hint of a smoke ring so I assume the beef was smoked, and it was tender, but it lacked any real flavor. The Sauce: You've got your choice of three. The "house" sauce is a pretty standard vinegar tomato sauce. It's good, but nothing to write home about. The setup on the table also included a mustard based sauce (a Carolina thing I guess) which was tasty on the sweet potato fries, and a chipotle sauce which was the best of the bunch, but still pretty mild. The Sides: The cole slaw was really good. Crisp cabbage with a fair amount of carrot, and not too much mayo. The beans were good. Smokey and tasty. And the sweet potato fries were outstanding. Crispy and salty (my two favorite food groups). The Staff: Awesome! Friendly and attentive without hovering over us to the point of uncomfortable. The Other Stuff: The Red Velvet Cake was really, really good. Not too sweet, moist, great crumb, cream cheese frosting that tasted like...cream cheese. Save some room and share a slice with your table mates. The Price: It was a bit more than I expected for "cue" but all in all, a good value for your dollar. Overall, Pig Iron is better than most of the BBQ places in the Seattle area that I've tried (and I've tried quite a few) If Gordy's were still open in North Bend, Pig Iron wouldn't hold a candle to it, but it's not so Pig Iron is a nice alternative. I lived in central Texas for over a decade(where there is real bbq) so I think my opinion counts here. The food here is about the best BBQ I have found in Seattle, that being said...it still is not on par with any of the million BBQ joints in the south. First off it is inconsistent, one day you may get a good smoke ring on the brisket and it is nice and moist, and the next it is dried out and flavorless. The very worst thing about Seattle BBQ is the price, BBQ is supposed to be the poor peoples food, which means cheap. Pig Iron does not disappoint in the price dept, IT IS CRAZY EXPENSIVE FOR BBQ! &#160;Give it a shot, it may be good that day, but be prepared to pay! About the only thing going for Pig Iron is Shiner Draft... Melt-in-your mouth BBQ. &#160;Just how yo momma made it side dishes. &#160;A cool trucker/biker/piercings/jailhouse tats vibe. &#160;Waitstaff that looks scary but who are actually super cool and friendly. &#160;Oh Jesus they have sweet tea too! Just hook it up to an IV on my muthatruckin arm...I'm home baby!The sweet potato fries can be limp and soggy sometimes but when they're not you want to stand up and sign an aria. &#160;Either way I will admit that they are tasty. &#160;Go to Pig Iron BBQ often. &#160;But don't tell too many people about it. &#160;Let's just keep this secret to ourselves, K? &#160;It is just THAT good. Yum... i love it. Certainly my favorite BBQ-esque joint in the Seattle area.Don't miss the jalapeno-spinach greens... they are to die for. In fact, they should be promoted from side dish to main dish, if you ask me.I'm kind of surprised at all the bad reviews, but I understand that there are a lot of traditionalists out there that insist on BBQ being prepared a certain way. I'm really kind of surprised by all the 5star reviews. I definitely didn't find it offensive enough to rate 1 star, but it was definitely nothing special.The pulled pork was moist, but the sauce was pretty flavorless. The slaw was a bit more carrot heavy than I tend to like, but again- pretty bland.Yes, I'm from the south- I take my BBQ seriously. However, I brought a friend along from NYC who doesn't have much experience with BBQ- the first thing he commented on as we left was how bland everything was.Not terrible, not great. Definitely not worth $10 for a sandwich and a side. On a positive note, the sweet tea was almost the closest thing I've tasted to a real glass since I moved up here. Been a while since I've been here... But I absolutely loved this place. But my first choice is Caveman out in Kent. But this place comes a close second because it's so close to where I live. My hubby and I had a pulled pork sandwhich with slaw and the sweet potato fries with the fried green tomatoes as a starter. Loved the green tomatoes but the sauce for them was kinda on the salty side.The food was great and so was the service. I myself have 10 tattoos and it's nice to see other people working "normal," out in the open jobs and not having their employer be discrimitive.Definately wanna go back here some time soon... 1 word....SLATHER! The 'slather' sauce that goes with the fries is SO good! Their sweet potato fries are some of the best in the area, so I highly recommend those and their fried green tomatoes. Add some slather and you're good to go!Their pulled pork sandwich is by far my favorite thing on the menu, but their ribs are a close second. (my mouth is watering just talking about it!). I worked in Georgetown for 3 years and this place made the "take out" list quite often with me and my coworkers. If you are going in to sit down, don't expect much from the decor, but expect a lot from the food! Great barbecue places have long wooden benches with protruding nails that give you tetanus. What I'm saying is, the food tastes better when the decor is not contrived, and the food is great here. Juicy, tender meat with sweet and savory sauces, and just the right amount of grease. Gross? &#160;Yes. &#160;I think the pulled pork was really from the large rat traps they have stationed underneath the crawl space of the place. (yes, we saw huge rat traps) &#160;Ok, so I'm exaggerating, but when our order of a pulled pork sandwich arrived, it was on a plain white bun that was cold. &#160;Not even grilled inside. &#160;The meat was dry and at room temperature and had no detectable smokiness to it. &#160;The sweet potato fries were more "fun" than tasty, as they had an interesting mayo based dip and various BBQ sauces to immerse them in. &#160;The beans were pretty good though super sweet. &#160;I left hungry, because I didn't want to gorge myself on the boring bun and mediocre meat. &#160;Even if the meat had actually tasted like it was smoked, it still would have been over-priced for what we were served. &#160;Disappointed..... Full liquor is a nice option for lunch, but not if I have to go back to work. &#160;The bbq is decent, not my favorite, I guess I like the real Southern kind; either that, or I'm just darn picky. &#160;I like the decor of the place, it fits the Georgetown mood of an industrial-yet-divey joint to satisfy some bbq needs. &#160;The fried green tomatoes are laughable, they're so bad and burned. &#160;The place is a bit more expensive than what you would consider a value. Good pulled pork sandwich, but a little pricy. Coleslaw was very good.
This is a great bistro. Wish there were more of them in the city. Nicely decorated, service good and the food was excellent. Yum! I had the salmon with lemon butter and my husband had a meat dish - can't remember what it's called. We split a sald and the dressing was to die for. We cleaned it out after with our bread. We each had a dessert after - tarte tartine and I had the profiteroles. Wish there had been more! I would highly recommend this place. We didn't get the chatty waiter - maybe next time! This was my second visit to Voia! This visit was just as good as the first. I tried the Cote de Porc Grillee (Grilled Pork Chop in Extra Virgin Olive Oil, Lemon, Garlic &amp; Herbs). The Pork Chop was very tender and the combination of the oil, lemon, garlic and herbs was delicious! This is one of my favorite bistros in Seattle. It's just the right size. It's not too small that you feel cramped, and it's not too big that it gets too noisy on a busy night. The service is just as good as the food. Our waiter was very knowledgeable. This is the perfect bistro for a nice date or a special occasion. I had a lovely dinner with friends at this small, cozy french restaurant. &#160;It has a great atmosphere and the meals are really affordable ($12-$15). &#160;I had the Cote de Porc Grillee &#160;(pork chop!) which was awesome.
